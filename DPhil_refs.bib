  abstract = {The effects of level of stone cover, stone size and rain intensity
	on infiltration, erosion and water splash from a silty loam soil
	(Calcic Haploxeralf) were studied using a laboratory rainfall simulator.
	Square asbestos cement plates (5 mm thick), measuring 100 and 2500
	mm2, were used to simulate stones. Three levels of surface cover
	(0, 25 and 50\% cover) and two rain intensities (21 and 45 mm h-1)
	were studied. An increase in the level of stone cover increased infiltration
	and reduced erosion. The size of the asbestos cement plates had no
	effect on either infiltration or erosion. An increase in rainfall
	intensity resulted in a moderate increase in infiltration and a significant
	increase in soil erosion. Water splash from bare soil (control) reached
	15.9\% of the applied rain, thereby signifying its importance in
	simulated rainfall studies. An increase in the level of stone cover
	reduced water splash. By mulching with small plates, a lower percentage
	of water splash occurred, compared with large plates and the control.
	Rain intensity had no effect on water splash.},

  abstract = {Soil conservation measures may be better designed with the knowledge

	daily erosion distributions is costly; however, new process-based
	soil erosion models have the potential to simulate extended records.
	The objectives of this study were to analyze frequency distributions
	of measured daily soil loss values and to determine if the Water
	Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model accurately reproduced statistical
	distributions of the measured daily erosion series. A Log-Pearson
	Type III (LP III) distribution was fitted to measured and WEPP-predicted
	soil loss values from six sites for periods ranging from 6 to 10
	yr. Cumulative soil loss as a function of storm recurrence interval
	was used to show the relative contributions of large and small storms
	to total soil loss at each site. Results showed that both measured
	and predicted frequency curves fell within the 95% confidence range
	of the LP III distributions. This was true both using weather data
	from the site for the period of monitoring as well as when using
	synthetic weather series generated with the CLIGEN model. Thus the
	results were encouraging in terms of using WEPP in conjunction with
	CLIGEN to generate long term daily soil loss frequency distributions,
	which can contribute toward alleviating the problem of having only
	a short monitoring period for measured erosion. Cumulative soil loss
	results indicated that large storms contributed a major portion of
	the erosion under conditions where cover was high, but not necessarily
	under conditions of low cover.},

	A sensitivity analysis reveals that the model is sensitive to parameters
	that are easily measured or estimated: rainfall intensity, the mean
	volume drop diameter of the intercepted throughfall, canopy cover,
	and canopy height. The results of the model may be used at two levels.
	Firstly, to calculate specifically the size and fall velocity of
	individual drops, parameters that are needed in studies examining
	the response of soil surfaces to forces applied by rainfall. Secondly,
	to produce erosivity indices, based on rainfall intensity but which
	take account of the effects of a vegetation canopy. The paper shows
	that while the kinetic energy of rainfall (E(0), J mm-1 m-2) may
	be calculated from an equation of the familiar form: E(0) = 8.95
	+ 8.44 log INTENSITY (mm hr-1) the kinetic energy of throughfall
	under any canopy may be calculated by combining this equation with

	increased the hydraulic efficiency by reducing short-circuit or preferential

  number = {3-4},
  abstract = {The importance of the inherent resistance of soil to erosional processes,
	or soil erodibility, is generally recognized in hillslope and fluvial
	geomorphology, but the full implications of the dynamic soil properties
	that affect erodibility are seldom considered. In Canada, a wide
	spectrum of soils and erosional processes has stimulated much research
	related to soil erodibility. This paper aims to place this work in
	an international framework of research on water erosion processes,
	and to identify critical emerging research questions. It focuses
	particularly on experimental research on rill and interrill erosion
	using simulated rainfall and recently developed techniques that provide
	data at appropriate temporal and spatial scales, essential for event-based
	soil erosion prediction. Results show that many components of erosional
	response, such as partitioning between rill and interrill or surface
	and subsurface processes, threshold hydraulic conditions for rill
	incision, rill network configuration and hillslope sediment delivery,
	are strongly affected by spatially variable and temporally dynamic
	soil properties. This agrees with other recent studies, but contrasts
	markedly with long- held concepts of soil credibility as an essentially
	constant property for any soil type. Properties that determine erodibility,
	such as soil aggregation and shear strength, are strongly affected
	by climatic factors such as rainfall distribution and frost action,
	and show systematic seasonal variation. They can also change significantly
	over much shorter time scales with subtle variations in soil water
	conditions, organic composition, microbiological activity, age-hardening
	and the structural effect of applied stresses. Property changes between
	and during rainstorms can dramatically affect the incidence and intensity
	of rill and interrill erosion and, therefore, both short and long-term
	hillslope erosional response. Similar property changes, linked to
	climatic conditions, may also significantly influence the stability
	and resilience of plant species and vegetation systems. Full understanding
	of such changes is essential if current event-based soil erosion
	models such as WEPP and EUROSEM are to attain their full potential
	predictive precision. The complexity of the interacting processes
	involved may, however, ultimately make stochastic modelling more
	effective than physically based modelling in predicting hillslope
	response to erodibility dynamics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The importance of extreme events in controlling erosion and sediment
	transport in semi-arid areas has long been appreciated but in practice
	being by definition rare and episodic they are difficult to study.
	When they are observed this is frequently in catchments for which
	little data are available. Another difficulty is that even when catchments
	are being monitored the instruments that record discharge, sediment
	load and hillslope sediment fluxes perform inaccurately or unpredictably
	during extreme weather conditions. This paper describes slope and
	channel processes that were actually observed by the authors during
	a (at least) I : 30 year 30 minute event with a rainfall intensity
	of 240 mm h(-1) in a second-order tributary of the Rio Camacho near
	Tarija in southern Bolivia. During the event, it could be observed
	how different tributary streams and slope sections contributed sediments
	and flow to the main channel. Evidence for these contributions did
	not survive the event, which has implications for both modelling
	and monitoring. Before the onset of the event open erosion plots
	were functioning on the slopes where rainfall and runoff were being
	measured. Rainfall experiments were used to obtain infiltration rates.
	The storm began with a moderate intensity of about 5 cm per hour
	but increased after 5 minutes to 30 cm per hour and continued for
	30 minutes. At this time, the rainfall intensity greatly exceeded
	the infiltration capacity and water started draining the steep slopes.
	The ephemeral channel rapidly filled up with runoff. Erosion by hailstones
	was considerable. Provisionally, the discharge during peak runoff
	was estimated at 43.7 m 3 s(-1) (Manning equation). On the basis
	of sediment loads carried by previous storms, (average concentration
	of 21 g l(-1)) the total suspended load discharge during the storm
	would have been 15 ton ha(-1). Within the ephemeral channel, 10 to
	50 cm thick layers of coarse sediments were deposited. The collectors
	of the open erosion plots could not handle the large amounts of runoff
	and sediment and were completely filled to overflowing. Comparing
	these data with soil losses during less intense storms it can be
	concluded that extreme events largely contribute to erosion and sediment
	transport and that the majority of the rainstorms play only a minor
	role. The results also show how limited the values of rainfall experiments
	are in understanding geomorphic events. This makes modelling of erosion
	and soil losses a difficult and hazardous task. Copyright (C) 2002

	of rates of soil erosion by water on hillslopes with reasonable success,
	they are less competent when there is a need to apply a spatial dimension
	to their estimates. In particular, the initiation and development
	of rill networks is poorly modelled. Observations from field and
	laboratory suggest that it is possible to apply an evolutionary analogy
	to rill growth and development. Microrills, formed both by the runoff
	resulting from individual raindrops and from the overflow of ponded
	surface water through knickpoints, can be thought of as "competing".
	The most "successful" of these become discontinuous rills, which
	in their turn also compete, with a subset dominating to form continuous
	rills., Rill "success" will depend on both the position on the slope
	and microtopography. However, microtopography will itself be modified
	by erosional processes such as rill growth. This creates a feedback
	loop. Is it possible to use this perspective to model the evolution
	of hillslope rill networks? This study investigates the feasibility
	of such an approach. A novel model is described which applies simple

	rill networks appear realistic, as does rill depth, which increases
	both downslope and below confluences. Simulated rill spacing conforms
	with observed relationships to slope angle; the spatial balance between

	Previous studies have concentrated only on estimating shifts in long-

	However such simple shifts mask changes in the underlying distributions
	of annual erosion. A first series of simulations indicated that,
	under a wetter climate, erosion rates in wet years will generally
	increase more than rates in dry years. Under a ''best guess'' rainfall
	scenario with a 10% increase in winter rainfall, annual erosion increased
	by up to 150%. Erosion rates for individual years were shown to change
	in more complex nonlinear ways however, with decreases as well as
	increases occurring. These could be explained by the interaction
	of timing of rainfall with changes in the rate of crop growth. Most
	earlier work also assumed an equilibrium climate for the simulations,
	with climatic parameters such as mean monthly rainfall having stabilised
	at some new value, usually for a 2 x CO2 atmosphere. This however
	leads to an ''initial conditions'' problem: how will soil characteristics
	have changed by the time of CO2 doubling? A decrease in erodibility
	of about 20% by the time of CO2 doubling was indicated, resulting
	from changed soil profile properties. However, a second series of

  abstract = {One consequence of global change will be shifts in the probability
	of occurrence of soil erosion by water. This could have serious consequences
	for those areas of the world which are present-day 'hotspots' for
	erosion. By means of a case study, this paper suggests an approach
	to quantifying the change in risk of serious erosion for sites in
	such areas. The case study focuses on future erosion under intensive
	soya bean cultivation in the Mate Grosso area of Brazil. On the area's
	highly erodible latosols, current erosion problems are severe. Scenarios
	of change future climate change are taken from general circulation
	models (GCMs) and used to perturb current-climate weather data. These
	are input to an erosion model (water erosion prediction project (WEPP)-CO2),
	together with local knowledge regarding current and probable future
	land use, in order to estimate future changes in erosion rates. WEPP-simulated
	average annual sediment yield increases in one of the scenarios and
	decreases in the other two, reflecting the range of uncertainty in
	predictions of future rainfall. Using the 'best-guess' climate scenario
	from the UK Meteorological Office's HADCM2 GCM, the increase in mean
	annual sediment yield is 27%. Increases are disproportionately greater
	in wetter years. Average rates for individual months increase by
	over 100%. Erosion increases most on those parts of the hillslope
	profile which are currently hardest-hit by erosion. At present, an
	annual sediment yield of 5 t ha(-1) is currently exceeded in about
	1 year in 2. The HADCM2 simulations suggest that an equal or greater
	rate will occur in about 70% of years by around 2050. A rate of at
	least 10 t ha(-1) yr(-1) is currently exceeded in about 1 year in
	5. The HADCM2 simulations suggest that this will rise, to about 1
	year in 4. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	to investigate these effects on a small scale, a simulation experiment
	was conducted in Braganca, Northeast Portugal. The experimental setup
	consisted of 48 bottom perforated rectangular metal boxes (612 cm(2)),
	placed at a 10% slope, filled with 3.5 cm of a sieved silty loam
	soil over 2 cm of sand, covered by simulated rock fragments and maintained
	at near saturation. Twelve treatments, four replicates each, were
	exposed to 240 mm natural rainfall, comprising selected combinations
	of rock fragments size (small, medium-gravel range, and large-stone
	range), shape (rectangular and circular), position (surface, half-embedded
	and embedded) and cover percentage (17, 30 and 66%), and bare soil.
	Infiltration depth, runoff depth, washed and splashed sediment were
	repeatedly measured in appropriate collection devices. For bare soil,
	total wash and total splash were equivalent to 42.2 g m(-2) and 70.6
	g m(-2), respectively. Infiltration and runoff represented 52% and
	13% of total rainfall, respectively. Wash has a negative exponential
	relationship with rock fragment cover (RC). The regression coefficient
	varies negatively with cumulative precipitation, decreasing significantly
	after a surface seal is formed (at about 80 mm cumulative precipitation).
	The relationship between splash and RC, linear and negative, varies
	with time, too. Correlation with RC is positive for infiltration
	depth and negative for runoff depth, both reflecting the seal development
	with time. The effects of rock fragments size, position and form
	were tested for 30% RC. Size has a positive effect on runoff depth,
	wash and splash, and a negative effect on infiltration depth. The
	effect of rock fragment size on infiltration, runoff and erosion
	is more pronounced than that of position. The effect of shape was
	less significant than that of size and position. (C) 1998 Elsevier

	1985 to develop new-generation water erosion prediction technology
	for use by federal action agencies involved in soil and water conservation

	as a replacement for empirically based erosion prediction technologies,
	the WEPP model simulates many of the physical processes important
	in soil erosion, including infiltration, runoff, raindrop and flow
	detachment, sediment transport, deposition, plant growth, and residue
	decomposition. The WEPP project included an extensive field experimental
	program conducted on cropland, rangeland, and disturbed forest sites
	to obtain data required to parameterize and test the model. A large
	team effort at numerous research locations, ARS laboratories, and
	cooperating land-grant universities was needed to develop this state-of-the-art
	simulation model. WEPP project participants met frequently to coordinate
	their efforts. The WEPP model can be used for common hillslope applications
	or on small watersheds. Because it is physically based, the model
	has been successfully used in the evaluation of important natural
	resources issues throughout the U.S. and in many other countries.
	Upgrades to the modeling system since the 1995 DOS-based release
	include Microsoft Windows operating system graphical interfaces,
	web-based interfaces, and integration with Geographic Information
	Systems. Improvements have been made to the watershed channel and
	impoundment components, the CLIGEN weather generator, the daily water
	balance and evapotranspiration routines, and the prediction of subsurface
	lateral flow along low-permeability soil layers. A combined wind
	and water erosion prediction system with easily accessible databases

  abstract = {A statistical framework is presented for the assessment of climatological
	trends in the frequency of rare and extreme weather events. The methodology
	applies to long-term records of event counts and is based on the
	stochastic concept of binomial distributed counts. It embraces logistic
	regression for trend estimation and testing, and includes a quantification
	of the potential/limitation to discriminate a trend from the stochastic
	fluctuations in a record. This potential is expressed in terms of
	a detection probability, which is calculated from Monte Carlo-simulated
	surrogate records, and determined as a function of the record length,
	the magnitude of the trend and the average return period (i.e., the
	rarity) of events. Calculations of the detection probability for
	daily events reveal a strong sensitivity upon the rarity of events:
	in a 100-yr record of seasonal counts, a frequency change by a factor
	of 1.5 can be detected with a probability of 0.6 for events with
	an average return period of 30 days; however, this value drops to
	0.2 for events with a return period of 100 days. For moderately rare
	events the detection probability decreases rapidly with shorter record
	length, but it does not significantly increase with longer record
	length when very rare events are considered. The results demonstrate
	the difficulty to determine trends of very rare events, underpin
	the need for long period data for trend analyses, and point toward
	a careful interpretation of statistically nonsignificant trend results.
	The statistical method is applied to examine seasonal trends of heavy
	daily precipitation at 113 rain gauge stations in the Alpine region
	of Switzerland (1901-94). For intense events (return period: 30 days)
	a statistically significant frequency increase was found in winter
	and autumn for a high number of stations. For strong precipitation
	events (return period larger than 100 days), trends are mostly statistically
	nonsignificant, which does not necessarily imply the absence of a
	trend.},

  abstract = {Certain hydrological applications require estimates of maximum rainfall
	intensity values for short time durations, as it is the case of urban
	hydrology design among others. Short duration rainfall intensities
	are affected by a large uncertainty when durations under 10 or 5
	minutes are considered, especially when they are produced during
	extreme convective rainfall events. In this paper, 408 rainfall events
	have been statistically analyzed for the period 1925-1992 in Alicante
	(Spain). Maximum intensities for durations ranging from 2 minutes
	up to 240. minutes were extracted from the series, and described
	in terms of a set of GEV-three parameter extreme value distributions.
	The resulting quantiles; were plotted, and nine frequently used empirical
	functions i(max)(t) were fitted, including 2-parameter and 3-parameter
	functions. Considerable differences are found in the behaviour of
	the empirical functions for short durations (t < 10 minutes). A systematic
	comparison is performed in all cases, with return periods ranging
	from 5 to 500 hundred years, assessing reliability of the estimates
	of maximum rainfall intensities for short durations. The 3-parameter
	functions together with the Talbot function provide satisfactory
	goodness-of-fit, although in most cases, underestimation of maximum
	rainfall intensities for very short durations is observed. On the
	other hand, the postulated empirical Intensity-Duration-Frequency
	(idf) relationships are more suitable when data for larger durations
	(i.e. t < 60 min) are considered. This result is consistent with
	the consideration of essentially different dynamics of the maximum
	rainfall intensities producing mechanisms at the different time scales.

	intensities to runoff plots (3.0 m by 10.7 m) with dry, wet, and
	very wet antecedent moisture conditions, and during two late and
	one early summer seasons. Supplemental overland flow was added at

	30 m, after which the effect of slope length declined. Surface crust
	development and mound-intermound microtopography played important

  abstract = {In many parts of the world attempts to discern climatic-driven changes
	in river flow patterns are hindered by the combined impact of other,
	more direct anthropogenic disturbances such as abstraction and impoundments.
	This study capitalises on a newly defined �benchmark� network of
	natural catchments in the UK to discern natural variability in flow
	regimes. Trend tests were applied to time series of runoff and indicators
	of low-flow magnitude and duration for two study periods to assess
	the sensitivity of trends to the frame of reference over which tests
	were conducted. Notwithstanding the volatility of the recent past,
	the results demonstrate a general stability in runoff and low flows
	since the early 1960s. The strongest signal to emerge from the study
	is a positive runoff trend for catchments in Scotland, which was
	resilient to the effect of the study periods. There was also some
	indication of increasing runoff in maritime western areas of England
	and Wales. These increases in maritime areas are likely to reflect
	the dominance of westerly airflows in the recent past, associated
	with an increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index. For
	low flows, there were no compelling trends�-�significant positive
	trends over the 1973-2002 period are influenced by a sequence of
	notably dry years at the start of the period and were not observed
	over a 40-year time-frame. There are some indications of a tendency
	towards decreasing low flows in some eastern catchments, but this
	is supported by few significant results. The results of this study
	provide a baseline against which to assess longer-term change from
	historical flow time series and to monitor future change in the benchmark
	network. Copyright � 2006 Royal Meteorological Society},

	these operate on all transport-limited slopes. Their efficacy varies
	directly with precipitation (or runoff) and inversely with vegetation
	cover. Sediment yield from these processes is also likely to increase
	with slope angle and, in the case of slope mash and rill erosion,
	with rainfall intensity and slope length. Sloughing from oversteepened
	banks, however, occurs where rivers are actively cutting into valley
	sides. The frequency of occurrence of such locations increases with
	the mean slope angle, and the frequency of collapse increases with
	runoff. Thus, this process is likely to be dominant in mountainous
	areas with high runoff. Expressing these effects analytically leads
	to a tentative general relation for specific sediment yield. If we
	had sufficient knowledge of the various parameters involved, this
	relation could be integrated over a basin to obtain the total yield.
	At present, however, its main value is to draw attention to the numerous

  abstract = {One of the tasks of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme-Global
	Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (IGBP-GCTE) Soil Erosion Network
	is to determine the suitability of modelling approaches for the estimation
	of soil erosion under global change. To achieve this, current erosion
	models are being evaluated in a series of GCTE meetings. This paper
	presents a synthesis of results from the first two meetings, which
	focused upon models for soil erosion by water at field and catchment
	scales, respectively. Apart from this comparison, discussions were
	held on model use and quality. The main conclusions from these discussions
	are included here as well. For both sets of evaluations, common datasets
	which had been split into a [`]training set' and a [`]testing set'
	were prepared and distributed to the participating modellers. For
	the [`]testing set' data, measured values for runoff and sediment
	yield (field-scale models) or for erosion only (catchment-scale models)
	were withheld from the modellers. The data used for the field-scale
	evaluation represented 73 site-years from seven sites in three countries:
	six field-scale erosion models took part in the evaluation. For the
	catchment-scale evaluation, data for 10 events on a 40 ha catchment
	in the Netherlands was used to evaluate seven catchment models. Conclusions
	from both field-scale and catchment-scale exercises include the following:
	- calibration is desirable for many models, and necessary for some.
	Calibration is most effective if the event(s) to be estimated lie
	inside the range of calibration events; - total discharge is generally
	better predicted than peak discharge and both are better predicted
	than sediment discharge; - for continuous-simulation models, long-term
	average results are better simulated than results for individual
	time periods. In general, results are less good for shorter time
	periods, although there are exceptions; - while for certain events
	models may not perform well (absolute results), correlation coefficients
	between observed and predicted values are acceptable (relative results);
	- at a catchment scale, the predicted spatial runoff pattern is as
	important as a correct prediction of the net output; - from the discussions
	it was clear that additional [`]soft' information, in particular
	regarding the change in soil structure as a result of agricultural
	activities and/or climate, greatly improves the quality of input
	data and model results.},

	changes are compared against those produced by the driving global
	general-circulation model (GCM). The domain-averaged increases in
	temperature and moisture content are similar in both models. Because
	of a stronger hydrological cycle the increases in precipitation and
	evaporation are larger in the RCM than in the GCM, whereas the reductions
	in lower and middle tropospheric relative humidity and cloud cover
	are smaller. The frequency of intense precipitation events increases
	substantially in both models; however, the fractional changes are
	significantly smaller in the RCM. The proportion of precipitation
	associated with convection also increases in both models; however,
	much of the increase in intense events is explained simply by increased
	atmospheric moisture concentrations, especially in the RCM. The time-averaged
	precipitation changes in the RCM contain a substantial mesoscale
	component on scales not resolved by the GCM. Attempts are made to
	reconstruct this component from the changes in the large-scale atmospheric
	circulation using empirical relationships calibrated from the 1 x
	CO2 integration. These are largely unsuccessful, indicating that
	simple downscaling schemes to generate high-resolution scenarios
	of climate change from coarse-grid GCM data may be of only limited
	applicability. Further statistical calculations suggest that longer
	integrations (similar to 30 years) are needed to reduce the sampling
	uncertainty associated with the simulated mesoscale component to
	an acceptable level. The large-scale patterns of change of surface
	temperature and precipitation reveal significant regional contrasts
	which are influenced both by changes in atmospheric circulation and
	regional physical feedbacks. The RCM changes are similar to those
	of the driving GCM except in summer. The differences in the summer
	changes are traced to differences between the 1xCO(2) integrations,
	in which the influence of the lateral boundary forcing on the RCM
	simulation is found to be anomalously weak. It is argued that any
	development of significant divergence between the RCM and GCM solutions

	replace the one-way nesting technique currently used in many regional
	modelling experiments.},

	primarily in the heavy and extreme daily precipitation events. For
	example, over half (53%) of the total increase of precipitation is
	due to positive trends in the upper 10 percentiles of the precipitation
	distribution. These trends are highly significant, both practically
	and statistically. The increase has arisen for two reasons. First,
	an increase in the frequency of days with precipitation [6 days (100
	yr)(-1)] has occurred for all categories of precipitation amount.
	Second, for the extremely heavy precipitation events, an increase
	in the intensity of the events is also significantly contributing
	(about half) to the precipitation increase. As a result, there is
	a significant trend in much of the United States of the highest daily
	year-month precipitation amount, but with no systematic national
	trend of the median precipitation amount. These data suggest that
	the precipitation regimes in the United States are changing disproportionately

	moderate events. These changes have an impact on the area of the

	Particles that fall back to the surface as a result of gravity produce
	a layer of pre-detached particles that provides a degree of protection

	make it difficult to control agrichemical movement in the southern
	fringe of the Corn Belt, USA. Ridge- and mulch-tillage systems were
	evaluated for root-zone water quality and grain production on a claypan
	soil. In northcentral Missouri the Mexico silt lam (fine, montmorillonitic,
	mesic Udollic Ochraqualfs; FAO-Mollic Planosols) has a pronounced
	B-t horizon. Zero-tension pan lysimeters at 91 cm were used to monitor
	nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and herbicide concentrations in three fanning
	systems: (I) a high chemical input mulch-tillage in a corn (Zea mays
	L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation (MTH); (2) a reduced
	chemical input with mulch-tillage in a corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum
	aestivum L.) rotation (MTR); (3) a reduced chemical input with ridge-tillage
	in a corn-soybean rotation (RTR). Farming system treatments were
	replicated three times with lysimeters placed in two replications.
	By band-applying herbicide over rows, herbicide mass applied to the
	MTR and RTR system was 50% less than applied to MTH, where herbicides
	were broadcast. Only marginal benefits to root-zone water quality
	could be attributed to this reduced herbicide input. Leachate water
	how volume and chemical concentration intercepted by the pans were
	influenced more by intrinsic, site-specific soil hydrology and year-to-year
	variation of rainfall intensity and timing than by the management.
	Root-zone leachate in both MTH and RTR farming systems in 1992 were
	below USEPA maximum contaminant levels (MCL) of 10 mg l(-1) for NO3-N
	and 3 mu g l(-1) for atrazine used for drinking water. Rainfall after
	herbicide application was more frequent and intense in 1993, but
	the extent of leaching was site-specific with significant variation
	among plots within all treatments. For example, maximum NO3-N and
	atrazine concentrations in leachate were 42 mg l(-1) and 100 mu g
	l(-1), respectively, in one MTH plot, and in second plot they were
	below 7 mg l(-1) and 2 mu g l(-1), respectively. High concentration
	variability also occurred between RTR plots. Nitrate-N and atrazine
	were consistently below their MCL on MTR plots. While herbicide movement
	and loss may be slightly reduced with banding, this management will
	have low adoption on claypan soils because of the yield-loss risks
	associated with the small time window allowed for field operations.
	The same risk is associated with split N applications. (C) 1998 Elsevier

  abstract = {The goal of the present study was to assess the impact of selected
	soil protection measures on soil erosion and retention of rainwater
	in a 1·14 km2 watershed used for agriculture in the north-east of
	Austria. Watershed conditions under conventional tillage (CT), no-till
	(NT) and under grassland use were simulated using the Water Erosion
	Prediction Project (WEPP) soil erosion model. The period 1961–90
	was used as a reference and results were compared to future Intergovernmental
	Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios A1B and A2 (2040–60).The
	simulations for the NT and grassland options suggested runoff would
	decrease by 38 and 75%, respectively, under the current climatic
	conditions. The simulation results suggest that, under future climate
	scenarios, the effectiveness of the selected soil conservation measures
	with respect to runoff will be similar, or decreased by 16–53%.The
	actual average net soil losses in the watershed varied from 2·57
	t/ha/yr for conventional soil management systems to 0.01 t/ha/yr
	for grassland. This corresponds to a maximum average annual loss
	of about 0·2 mm, which is considered to be the average annual soil
	formation rate and therefore an acceptable soil loss. The current
	soil/land use does not exceed this limit, with most of the erosion
	occurring during spring time. Under future climate scenarios, the
	simulations suggested that CT would either decrease soil erosion
	by up to 55% or increase it by up to 56%. Under these conditions,
	the acceptable limits will partly be exceeded. The simulations of
	NT suggested this would reduce annual soil loss rates (compared to
	CT) to 0·2 and 1·4 t/ha, i.e. about the same or slightly higher than
	for NT under actual conditions. The simulation of conversion to grassland
	suggested soil erosion was almost completely prevented.The selected
	soil conservation methods maintain their protective effect on soil
	resources, independent of the climate scenario. Therefore, with small
	adaptations, they can also be recommended as sustainable soil/land
	management systems under future climatic conditions.However, based
	on the available climate scenarios, climate-induced changes in the
	frequency and intensity of heavy rainstorms were only considered
	in a limited way in the present work. As the general future trend
	indicates a strong increase of rainstorms with high intensity during
	summer months, the results of the present study may be too optimistic.},

  journal = {Earth Surface Processes and Landforms},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {25},
  pages = {709-721},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {Rainfall simulators are widely used yet there is little evidence in
	the literature to show that their spatial and temporal variability
	has been adequately taken into account. For experiments that are
	concerned only with some aggregate or mean effect of simulated rain
	then such variations may be unimportant. However, where rainfall
	simulation is being used to study (and perhaps model) small-scale
	processes that are themselves spatially variable (such as rill initiation)
	then knowledge of the simulator's inherent variability is vital.
	A first aim of this paper is therefore to examine this variability,
	and to appraise methodologies by which it may be quantified. A second
	aim is to evaluate the implications for spatially explicit rainfall
	simulation experiments. Two simulators were used, a portable drip-screen
	simulator and a laboratory-based full-cone nozzle simulator. Neither
	produced a spatially uniform distribution of rainfall depth: both
	produced distributional patterns that were fairly consistent despite
	varying intensities and run times. Small-scale, apparently random
	variations were superimposed on these more deterministic patterns.
	However, despite this marked spatial variability, calculation of
	uniformity coefficients (1-SD/mean) resulted in high values. Thus
	it appears that the uniformity coefficient gives little real indication
	of the spatial uniformity of simulated rainfall, despite its established
	usage in the literature. Additionally, spatial distributions of raindrop
	size -and hence kinetic energy -were calculated for the full- cone
	nozzle simulator. These show that zones of high rainfall amount do
	not necessarily relate to zones of high energy reaching the surface.
	The presence of such variability raises a number of issues for spatially
	explicit rainfall simulation experiments. While there has been little
	work on the spatial variability of natural rainfall at field scale
	and smaller, it appears that the spatial heterogeneity of simulated
	rainfall depths observed in this study does not differ greatly from
	that of natural rain. But since a major attraction of rainfall simulation
	experiments is additional control over rainfall's many variables,
	the spatial non-uniformity of depth observed in this Study is unwelcome.
	The existence of an apparently deterministic component lo this non-uniformity
	nonetheless suggests that it can, at least in principle, be corrected
	by calibration. Less easily handled is the discrepancy between spatial
	distributions of rainfall depth and energy, since this will certainly
	affect rainfall simulation experiments that are, for example, concerned
	with erosion processes due to raindrop impact. Copyright (C) 2000

  abstract = {Empirical soil erosion models continue to play an important role in
	soil conservation planning and environmental evaluations around the
	world. The effect of hillslope length on soil loss, often termed
	the slope length factor, is one of the main and most variable components
	of any empirical model. In the most widely used model, the Universal
	Soil Loss Equation (USLE), normalized soil loss, L, is expressed
	as a power function of slope length, lambda, as L = (lambda/22.1)(m),
	in which the slope exponent, m, is 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 for different,
	increasing slope gradients. In the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation
	(RUSLE), the exponent, m, is defined us a continuous function of
	slope gradient and the expected ratio of rip to interrill erosion.
	When the slope gradient is 60% and the ratio of rill to interrill
	erosion is classified as moderate, the exponent m has the value of
	0.71 in RUSLE, as compared with 0.5 for the USLE. The purpose of
	this study was to evaluate the relationship between soil loss and
	slope length for slopes up to 60% in steepness. Soil loss data from
	natural runoff plots at three locations on the Loess Plateau in China
	and data from a precious study were used. The results indicated that
	the exponent, m, for the relationship between soil loss and the slope
	Length for the combined data from the three stations in the Loess
	Plateau was 0.44 (r(2) = 0.95). For the data as a whole, the exponent
	did not increase as slope steepness increased from 20 to 60%. We
	also found that the value of m was greater for intense storms than
	for less intense storms. These experimental data indicate that the
	USLE exponent, m = 0.5, is more appropriate for steep slopes than
	is the RUSLE exponent, and that the slope length exponent varies

  abstract = {Glenwood Springs, Colorado, lies at the junction of the Roaring Fork
	and Colorado Rivers, surrounded by the steep peaks of the Colorado
	Rocky Mountains. Large parts of the region have had intensive sheet
	erosion, debris flows, and hyperconcentrated floods triggered by
	landslides and slumps. The latter come from unstable slopes in the
	many tributary channels on the mountainsides, causing concentration
	of debris in channels and a large accumulation of sediment in colluvial
	wedges and debris fans that line the river valleys. Many of the landslide
	and debris-flow deposits exist in a state resembling suspended animation,
	ready to be destabilized by intense precipitation and/or seismic
	activity. During this century urban development in the Roaring Fork
	River valley has increased rapidly. The city of Glenwood Springs
	continues to expand over unstable debris fans without any construction
	of hazard mitigation structures. Since 1900, Glenwood Springs has
	had at least 21 damaging debris flows and floods; on July 24, 1977
	a heavy thunderstorm spread a debris flow over more than 80 ha of
	the city. This paper presents a method that uses Geographic Information
	Systems (GIS) to assess geological hazards, vulnerability, and risk
	in the Glenwood Springs area. The hazards evaluated include subsidence,
	rockfall, debris flows, and floods, and in this paper we focus on
	debris flows and subsidence. Information on topography, hydrology,
	precipitation, geomorphic processes, bedrock and surficial geology,
	structural geology, soils, vegetation, and land use, was processed
	for hazard assessment using a series of algorithms. ARC/INFO and
	GRASS GIS softwares were used to produce maps and tables in a format
	accessible to urban planners. After geological hazards were defined
	for the study area, we estimated the vulnerability (V(e)) of various
	elements for an event of intensity i. Risk is assessed as a function
	of hazard and vulnerability. We categorized the study area in 14
	classes for planning procedures; 7 classes defined as areas suitable
	for human settlement, and 7 classes defined as unsuitable for building,
	and most effectively reserved for parks and forests.},

  abstract = {The impact of the expected climate change on the frequency and extent
	of soil erosion processes is hardly assessable so far. This is mainly
	because available models of climate change reliably produce at best
	mean daily precipitation data, whereas erosion is the result of extreme
	but short time rainfall and runoff events, normally lasting no longer
	than a few hours. The frequency and intensity of these extreme rainfall
	events are expected to increase in some regions, which could lead
	to increased erosion rates. Mathematical models are able to describe
	erosion rates under conditions of these extreme events, however,
	so far prognostic meteorological data necessary for the application
	of these models are not available. The use of a new method for the
	projection of meteorological time series and their extremes using
	global climate simulations [Enke and Spekat, 1997, Enke, 2000, Enke,
	2003, Enke et al., 2005 and Enke et al., in press] permits for the
	first time an approximation of future soil loss. This research is
	based on simulated, high resolution data for extreme rainfall events
	in the period of 2031-2050, which reproduces the mean frequency,
	intensity and duration of future events with high precipitation intensities
	relevant to erosion within the investigated seasonal period from
	June to August. The simulations are performed for two exemplary sites
	in Saxony, based on the EROSION 2D model (Schmidt, J., 1990. A mathematical
	model to simulate rainfall erosion, Catena, Suppl. 19), which is
	a process-based soil erosion model for simulating soil erosion and
	deposition by water on single slopes. Simulated precipitation for
	the 2031-2050 time period is used to model soil loss, and results
	are compared to soil loss based on 20 years of measured precipitation
	from 1981 to 2000. The simulation results allow the impacts of climate
	change on erosion rates to be quantified by comparing current climate
	with predicted, future climate. However, expected changes in land
	use due to changed economic conditions are not taken into account
	in this analysis.},

  abstract = {Future climate change is expected to impact the extent, frequency,
	and magnitude of soil erosion in a variety of ways. The most direct
	of these impacts refers to the projected increase in the erosive
	power of rainfall, whilst other more indirect impacts include changes
	in plant biomass and shifts in land use to accommodate the new climatic
	regime. Given the potential for climate change to increase soil erosion
	and its associated adverse impacts, modelling future rates of erosion
	is a crucial step in its assessment as a potential future environmental
	problem, and as a basis to help advise future conservation strategies.
	Despite the wide range of previous modelling studies, in the majority
	of cases limitations are apparent with respect to their treatment
	of the direct impacts (changed climate data), and their failure to
	factor in the indirect impacts (changing land use and management).
	In this study, these limitations are addressed in association with
	the modelling of future soil erosion rates for a case study hillslope
	in Northern Ireland using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)
	model. The direct impacts are handled using statistical downscaling
	methods, enabling the generation of site-specific, daily resolution
	future climate change scenarios, and a simple sensitivity analysis
	approach is employed to investigate the previously unstudied impacts
	of sub-daily rainfall intensity changes. Finally, the frequently
	neglected indirect impacts are examined using a scenarios-based approach.
	Results indicate a mix of soil erosion increases and decreases, depending
	on which scenarios are considered. Downscaled climate change projections
	in isolation generally result in erosion decreases, whereas large
	increases are projected when land use is changed from the current
	cover of grass to a row crop which requires annual tillage, and/or
	where large changes in sub-daily rainfall intensity are applied.
	The overall findings illustrate the potential for increased soil
	erosion under future climate change, and illuminate the need to address
	key limitations in previous studies with respect to the treatment
	of future climate change projections, and crucially, the factoring
	in of future land use and management.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of various soil erosion models with large data sets have
	consistently shown that these models tend to over-predict soil erosion
	for small measured values, and under-predict soil erosion for larger
	measured values. This trend appears to be consistent regardless of
	whether the soil erosion value of interest is for individual storms,
	annual totals, or average annual soil losses, and regardless of whether
	the model is empirical or physically based. The hypothesis presented
	herein is that this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with
	bias in model predictions as a function of treatment, but rather
	with limitations in representing the random component of the measured
	data within treatments (i.e., between replicates) with a deterministic
	model. A simple example is presented, showing how even a `perfect'
	deterministic soil erosion model exhibits bias relative to small
	and large measured erosion rates. The concept is further tested and
	verified on a set of 3007 measured soil erosion data pairs from storms
	on natural rainfall and run-off plots using the best possible, unbiased,
	real-world model, i.e., the physical model represented by replicated
	plots. The results of this study indicate that the commonly observed
	bias, in erosion prediction models relative to over-prediction of
	small and under-prediction of large measured erosion rates on individual
	data points, is normal and expected if the model is accurately predicting

	erosion field plots under natural rainfall, and thus determine the
	principal factor or factors which correlate to the magnitude of the

	decreased as a power function (r(2) = 0.78) of measured soil loss,

	and vegetation related parameters using common data from one humid
	and one semi-and watershed. Perturbations were made to inputs for
	rainfall intensities and amounts, and to ground surface cover and
	canopy cover. Principal results were that: soil erosion is likely
	to be more affected than runoff by changes in rainfall and cover,
	though both are likely to be significantly impacted; percent erosion
	and runoff will likely change more for each percent change in rainfall
	intensity and amount than to each percent change in either canopy

	changes in ground cover have a much greater impact on both runoff

	Though spatial variability of rain depth is important, even at the
	catchment scale, this variability has never been studied. In addition,
	little is known on rain erosivity for this part of the world. The
	objectives of this study are (a) to assess the spatial variation
	of rain in a 80 km(2) mountain area (2100-2800 m a.s.l.) in the Northern
	Tigray region, and how this variation is influenced by topography,
	geographical position and lithology, (b) to analyse the temporal
	variations and (c) to quantify rain erosivity and the different factors
	determining it, such as rain intensity, drop size and kinetic energy.Spatial
	variation of rain was measured over a 6-y period by installing 16
	rain gauges in the study area. Topographical factors, especially
	general orientation of the valley and slope gradient over longer
	distances, determine the spatial distribution of annual rain, which
	is in the order of 700 mm y(-1). Precipitation is highest nearby
	cliffs and other eminent slopes, perpendicular to the main valleys
	which are preferred flow paths for the air masses.Rain intensity
	is smaller than expected: 88% falls with an intensity < 30 mm h(-1).
	High intensities have a short duration; maximum recorded rain depth
	over I h (32 mm) is only 2 mm less than that over 24 It. Using the
	blotting paper method 65,100 rain drops were sampled. For all observed
	rain intensities, the median volume drop diameters (D-50) are significantly
	larger than those reported for other regions of the world. A relation
	between rain intensity (I) and volume specific kinetic energy (Ek(vol))
	was developed for the Ethiopian Highlands:Ek(vol) = 36.65(1 - (0.6/1))
	(R-2 = 0.99, n = 18), (Ek(vol) in J m(-2)mm(-1), I in min h(-) (1)).Due
	to the occurrence of large drop sizes, probably linked to the prevailing
	semi-arid to subhumid mountain climate, this relation yields, within
	the intensity range [0.6-84 mm h(-1)], larger values for Ek(vol)
	than elsewhere in the world.It is recommended to use this new relationship
	for calculating Ek(vol) of rain in the Ethiopian Highlands, as well
	as for the computation of Universal Soil Loss Equation's rain erosivity
	factor on yearly basis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	of crop management to climate change. Previous studies of erosion
	under climate change have not taken into account farmer choices of
	crop rotations or planting dates, which will adjust to compensate
	for climate change. In this study, changes in management were assigned
	based on previous studies of crop yield, optimal planting date, and
	most profitable rotations under climate change in the Midwestern
	United States. Those studies predicted future shifts from maize and
	wheat to soybeans based on price and yield advantages to soybeans.
	In the results of our simulations, for 10 of 11 regions of the study
	area runoff increased from +�10% to +�310%, and soil loss increased
	from +�33% to +�274%, in 2040-2059 relative to 1990-1999. Soil loss
	changes were more variable compared to studies that did not take
	into account changes in management. Increased precipitation and decreasing
	cover from temperature-stressed maize were important factors in the
	results. The soil erosion model appeared to underestimate the impact
	of change in crop type, particularly to soybeans, meaning that erosion
	increases could be even higher than simulated. This research shows
	that future crop management changes due to climate and economics
	can affect the magnitude of erosional impacts beyond that which would
	be predicted from direct climate change alone. Prediction of future
	soil erosion can help in the management of valuable cropland and

	This example is discussed in detail at each of the six phases of
	modeling and simulation. Two alternative models of the flight dynamics

	and decreasing then increasing intensity. The three soils were: a
	clay loam, a sandy loam and a sandy soil. No differences in total
	runoff were observed that were consistent across the three soil types.
	However, consistent differences were observed in the amount and size
	distribution of the eroded sediment. In particular, the constant-intensity
	storm yielded an average soil loss of 75\% of the varying-intensity
	storms, and the eroded sediment from the constant-intensity storms
	had a lower clay content than that from the varying-intensity storms.
	In contrast to the differences in amount and size distribution of

	factors that affect the erosion process. Direct effects of rainfall
	increases and decreases to runoff and erosion increases and decreases
	were observed but were often not dominant. One of the key factors
	of change in the system was the biomass production. Changes in soil
	moisture, atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature, and solar radiation
	each impacted the biomass production at differing levels at the eight
	different sites. Different types of changes occurring at different
	periods of the year also complicated the response of the system.
	Overall, these results suggest that where precipitation increases
	are significant, erosion can be expected to increase. Where precipitation
	decreases occur, the results may be more complex due largely to interactions
	of plant biomass, runoff, and erosion, and either increases or decreases
	in overall erosion may be expected.},

	sealing susceptibility of the soils, which reduced minimum rainfall

	the distinction of active gullies from inactive ones. The results
	show that gully activity is not correlated with the percentage of
	total vegetation cover, but with the percentage of cover of low vegetation
	in the gully floor. This is due to sediment trapping processes and
	highlights the importance of the spatial distribution of forest vegetation
	in reducing sediment yield at the gully outlet. Thus, gullies with
	similar total vegetation cover can have very different activities,
	and inactive gullies exist that are only partially covered with vegetation.
	Inactive gullies with as low as 33% vegetation cover occur where
	vegetation is mainly present in the gully floor. The results also

	storm structures and maximum rain rates, large raindrops with diameters
	greater than 5 mm occurred with each system. By comparing the occurrence

	cores or, occasionally, in stratiform regions where rainfall rates
	are relatively low. Disdrometer and polarimetric radar measurements

	dominated by small drops and overestimate rain rate when the DSD
	is dominated by large drops. The results indicate that a classification
	of different rain types (associated with different DSDs) should be
	an essential part of polarimetric rainfall estimation. Furthermore,
	observations suggest that Z(DR) is a key parameter for making such

	event that can produce intense erosion and even trigger the formation

	to a real situation, a rainstorm which took place on an experimental
	farm equipped for soil erosion studies was selected, The effects
	of the erosive rainstorm, which fell on dry antecedent moisture conditions,
	are given in terms of total rill erosion and rill cross-section along
	the slope. Unfortunately, the data collected did not answer the basic
	question, i.e., what combination of factors makes a rainstorm critical?
	A set of rainfall simulation experiments was therefore carried out,
	in the field and in the laboratory, in order to evaluate the soil
	surface variations caused by the rainstorm. All the experiments were
	performed on dry antecedent soil moisture conditions. It was confirmed
	that the characteristics of the infiltration curve are modified considerably
	during such rain events. The saturated conductivity of the first
	thin top-layer is also modified and it can easily decrease by a factor
	of 10 due to drop impact forces. The runoff coefficient is also influenced
	by the raindrop impacting energy and it increases sharply with cumulate
	energy until a maximum value is reached. The surface micro-relief
	dynamics was also studied. It was very clearly shown that impacting
	drop kinetic energy is the rainfall characteristic which is linked
	to random roughness decay. Cumulative rainfall was not able to align
	all the data in a single trend, The effect of surface micro-relief
	decay on the rainstorm erosive power was examined using two equations,
	thus linking Manning's hydraulic roughness to random roughness. Using
	a simulated runoff over the field plots that were particularly eroded
	by the rainstorm, it was possible to observe that the runoff drag
	forces reached values of between 3 and 100 times the ones which would
	have been calculated if the random roughness had been constant during
	the same event. Many of the soil surface characteristics that are
	modified interact with one another and with erosion. Examining each
	of them in isolation cannot explain the drastic increase in erosivity
	of a rainstorm, as the latter is the result of the combined effects
	of all the surface modifications. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

	using a piezoelectric saltation sensor (H11B; Sensit Co., Portland,

	between July and September 2006 in 21- and 36-year-old Japanese cypress
	(Chamaecyparis obtusa) plantations with mean stand heights of 9·2 m
	and 17·4 m, respectively. Splash detachment (in g m−2) was measured
	seven times using splash cups, and raindrop kinetic energy (in J m−2 mm−1)
	in both stands was measured using laser drop-sizing (LD) gauges.
	Sensit was installed to record saltation counts, which were converted
	to temporal data of splash detachment (splash rate; in g m−2 10 min−1)
	using the relationship between splash detachment and saltation counts.
	Surface runoff was monitored using runoff plots of 0·5 m width and
	2·0 m length to obtain temporal data of flow depth (in millimeters).
	Both total splash detachment and raindrop kinetic energy were larger
	in the older stand. Increased splash rates per unit throughfall were
	found in both stands after rainless durations longer than approximately
	one day in both stands. However, a lower splash rate was found in
	the 21-year stand after rainfall events. During extreme rainstorms,
	the 21-year stand showed a low runoff rate and a decline in the splash
	rate, while the 36-year stand showed a higher splash rate and increased
	flow depth. The piezoelectric sensor proved to be a useful means
	to elucidate splash erosion processes in field conditions. Copyright
