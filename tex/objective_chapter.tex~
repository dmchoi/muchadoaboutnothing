\end{quotation}

Before going into the aim of this research, it seems more appropriate to explain
the scope and direction of this research first. In this way, readers may
understand more clearly the research aim and rationale behind the approach used
in this study.

When this research was first begun, the initial plan was to use the simulated
future rainfall intensity output from RCM as input to one or more erosion
models, in order to improve upon then-current forecasts of future erosion rates
and eventually to develop a method to incorporate erosion model(s) into RCM.

However, after a number of test simulations with models at an early stage, it
became apparent that RCM rainfall data could not (and still cannot) be used
directly for erosion simulations. This is because RCM data do not hold
sufficiently detailed information that can be used for erosion simulations, and
were not reliable enough for this type of approach yet---and still they are
not \citep{nearing2001-229,michael2005-155,o'neal2005-165}. This means that, in
order to use RCM data for the approach proposed initially, the data should be
able to provide rainfall intensity information on a required scale with an
acceptable level of confidence.

Thus, another route was taken to resolve this issue. In order to obtain rainfall
data usable for erosion modelling in terms of scale and representable as
future rainfall, observed rainfall data were analysed to determine trends of
rainfall intensity. Once rainfall intensity trends are determined, probable
scenarios of future rainfall intensity changes can then be built by applying the
trend onto observed rainfall intensity.
%More on this approach is discussed in Chapter
%\ref{sec:RainfallCharacteristicsOfTheStudyArea}.

Rather later, more problems were identified with selected erosion models, in
that there were aberrant model responses to changes in a certain aspects of
rainfall intensity (See Chapter
\ref{sec:EFFECTSOFCONTINOUSANDDISCONTINUSSTORM}). This implied that there were
deficiencies in the process understanding on which the models are based. Thus,
the original plan had to be put on hold until both, improved erosion models and
more reliable RCM rainfall data, become available.

Accordingly, the focus of the research has evolved into the evaluation of the
response of erosion models to rainfall intensity changes, and implicitly the
process understanding on which the models are based, using arbitrary changes in
rainfall intensity. In turn, this will assist in improving the performance of
erosion models with respect to changes of rainfall intensity by highlighting
where the current problem exists. Consequently, greater knowledge here will,
once future changes in rainfall intensity become better known, improve our
ability to estimate future rates of erosion.

\section{Objectives and Rationales}
\label{sec:ResearchObjectives}

The main objective of this research is to investigate:
\begin{itemize}
 \item possible implications of climate change for future soil erosion with
reference to rainfall intensity changes by analysing the response of erosion
models to arbitrary rainfall intensity changes, and
 \item implicitly the process understanding on which the models are based.
\end{itemize}
To accomplish these aims, the research was carried out in three stages:
\textit{Rainfall Intensity and Erosion: Model Descriptions and
Responses},\textit{ Observed Rainfall Characteristics (and Intensity) of the
Study Site} and \textit{Implications for Model-based Studies of Future Climate
Change and Soil Erosion}.
%To accomplish this, the research was carried out as three stages:\
%\textsl{Rainfall Intensity and Erosion Modelling}, \textsl{Observed
%Precipitation of the Research Site} and \textsl{Implications for Future Climate
%Change and Erosion}.

In the first stage, \textsl{Rainfall Intensity and Erosion: Model Descriptions
and Responses}, three process-based erosion models, WEPP, EUROSEM and RillGrow,
were used to investigate their responses (i.e.\ runoff and soil loss rates) to
various rainfall intensity conditions. The process descriptions of these models
were examined in regard to how they make use of rainfall intensity.

The reason for using multiple models is to minimize the probability of
uncertainty that may increase when relying on a single model
\citep{ipcc2001-881}. The design purposes of erosion models varies from model to
model, and so do their artefacts \citep{favis-mortlock1998-141,jetten1999-521}.
Thus, it is problematic to use only one model, unless there are some
observational data that it can be compared to, as it is not possible to know to
what extent the result from the model is unique to that model
\citep{favis-mortlock1998-141,jetten1999-521}.

For the same reason, it was suggested that, in the study of future climate
change, one should not rely on a single GCM or RCM. This is also the case for
the downscaling \citep{mearns2003,wilby2004}. In such studies, the same
principle---more is better than one---is always in practice \citep{wilby2004}.
This principle may equally be applied to the study of soil erosion modelling.

It would have been possible to use only two erosion models. However, this may
have led to another problematic situation. For example, if two erosion models
show contrasting results, it will be very difficult to decide which one to
accept and which one to accept not---although it may still be debatable
whether the resulting conclusion is applicable to the reality even when both
models agree. A good answer to this dilemma may be found in an old fisherman's
saying: ``Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or \emph{three}.''
%****** good, but need to be clearer, since this is important
Therefore, \emph{three} erosion models were used in this study.
% in this thesis:\ WEPP,EUROSEM and RillGrow.

Comparing results from three models, instead of one or two models, may increase
our chances to relate modelling results back to the real world.
% provide less uncertainty than comparing results from one or two models.
If all three models show similar responses---even though the chances of
incurring such result are slim---to rainfall intensity changes, the agreed
results among three models may possibly be related to the real world
\citep{araujo2007-42}.
More importantly, however, when any of the models disagree, further
investigation should follow to look into the model equations, programmingg
algorithms and codes in order to find out what may have caused such
disagreement. By comparing outputs from these models, we could also identify
their weaknesses and, in turn, improve them for future researches.

A primary purpose of these erosion models (i.e. WEPP, EUROSEM and RillGrow) is
to simulate soil erosion.
Even though each model has its unique way of simulating erosion
processes, the main design purpose is the same; to simulate the real-world
erosion processes. Erosion models are developed in order
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
  \item to use them as important predictive tools for future or unmonitored
landscapes;
  \item to study how different factors play a role in erosion;
  \item to understand erosion processes; and in turn,
  \item to minimise environmental issues caused by soil
erosion.\end{inparaenum}\
Because of these purposes, \emph{ideally} all erosion models should be based on
similar understanding of erosion, and simulate erosion similarly. %really???
This general idea was taken into account and it was hypothesised that the
models selected for this research produce similar results when a given
rainfall intensity was applied to them.
Yet, the reality is somewhat different from the ideal, and one may still expect
that the models may produce divergent responses
\citep{favis-mortlock1998-141,jetten1999-521}. However, it is important to
investigate this diversity of model outputs in order to identify and improve
areas where our understanding is limited.
%because of physical difficulties in creating appropriate conditions to study.
%I need to support my argument more here. also, what extent the models are
%different and similar.

questions.'' (Samuel Karlin, Eleventh RA Fisher Memorial Lecture, Royal Society,
20 April 1983)
\end{quotation}

The above statement by Karlin highlights one of reasons why many models are used
in numerical and analytical studies. In most cases, a model is based on
knowledge that is limited by what we already know about the process. There can
be a range of different understandings of the same processes---soil erosion
processes in this case. These understandings are expressed as mathematical
equations, and then translated into computing languages, and finally put
together as a model with which our understandings of the processes can be
tested. This provides us with a complete control over affecting parameters.
Generally, it is not possible to gain complete control over affecting factors
with field experiments or with laboratory experiments because modifying only
one factor without altering other factors is not feasible. Using a model, an
individual input parameter may be isolated, adjusted and investigated to find
its effects on the overall erosion process, while keeping all the remaining
parameters constant. Of course, this still does not guarantee a correct
prediction by the model. However, this kind of approach helps to ``sharpen the
questions''. More focused questions from modelling studies may help to fill out,
or rather to pinpoint the gap in our understanding of the processes. There have
been several studies employing this type of approaches already
\citep{favis1995-365,favis1999-329,pruski2002-7,nearing2005-131}.

One more reason for using a model can be explained by the duration of
experiments. According to \citet{web_[Se-list]}, in the case of erosion-plot
experiments, the outcome may be very difficult to interpret unless the
experiments were conducted for \emph{a long period of time} because of high
variability in the observational data. The result may not be significant unless
the record is of sufficient length, treatments are greatly different, and a
sufficient number of replicates is employed \citep{nearing1999-1829}.
\citet{web_[Se-list]} stated ``\ldots it needs to be understood that these
estimates [which are estimated using short periods of record] can have great
error and that longer term records are needed to refine these estimates.'' He
then suggested to design plots and collect the data ``in such a way as to be
able to use the data in evaluation of models and development of parameters that
can be used to extrapolate results to the much wider climatic record than one
can experience in a few years''.
Hence, using a model can be a good choice of method over observational
experiments in some cases like above---and may well be the only method when
estimating a long-term effect which cannot be observed. For example, in the
study by \citet{favis-mortlock1997-79}, EPIC (Erosion-Productivity Impact
Calculator) was used to reproduce the past erosion processes on a hillslope in
South Downs, UK from 7000 BP to the present day, in order to find out the major
factors influencing past soil erosion. In a case like this, modelling is clearly
the only possible choice. Modelling is also the only choice for the study on
impacts of future climate or land-use changes on soil erosion
\citep{favis1995-365,favis1999-329,pruski2002-7,pruski2002-climate,
nearing2005-131}.

Therefore, the first stage of this study, using WEPP, EUROSEM and RillGrow, aims
to investigate:\
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
  \item necessary information for rainfall intensity properties to simulate soil
erosion,
  \item responses of selected models to changes of rainfall intensity
properties,
  \item underlying processes of the models for computing rainfall intensity
properties and
  \item the applicability of the same models in the subsequent research stages.
\end{inparaenum}

In the second stage, \textsl{Observed Rainfall Characteristics (and Intensity)
of the Study Site}, a series of observed high-resolution rainfall data were
obtained to determine a trend of rainfall intensity changes at the research site
in the South Downs, UK (Figure \ref{fig:DailyRainfallDataSite}). One of the
reasons for choosing this particular site is because the area has been
extensively monitored for soil erosion since the late 1970s
\citep{boardman1995-177,boardman2003-176}, so that data availability of the site
is therefore reasonably great. In addition, there is a well-established
expertise about the area that can be referenced to the current research
\citep{boardman1995-177,favis1995-365,favis-mortlock1997-79,
favis-mortlock1998-141,boardman2001-346,boardman2003-176}. The datasets used
here are temporally and spatially different; monthly 0.5\textdegree\ grid data,
daily station data and tipping-bucket gauge data.

Moreover, as stated previously, this approach was taken because of the important
issues discovered from RCM data. Probable scenarios of future rainfall intensity
were created based on the \textit{present-day} rainfall intensity trend. These
present trends were also compared with GCM predicted data. The resulting
scenarios were later used to make predictions regarding future erosion.

In short, the second stage aims to
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
  \item provide a solution for the problem that have been identified with RCM
rainfall data during the initial investigation of this research by analysing
observed rainfall data in the various scales to determine rainfall intensity
trends;
  \item build scenarios of future rainfall intensity based on the
\textit{present-day} rainfall intensity trend, which may, in turn, be used for
the final stage of the research.
\end{inparaenum}
%You imply that you are using present-day climate data to predict future
%erosion. No-one can do that! What you are doing, of course, is to create
%scenarios of future rainfall which are *based on* present-day rainfall (and
%then these are used to make predictions re. future erosion). *I* know that you
%know this, but the text isn't clear. Be as clear as possible: it is easy to
%create confusion in the mind of the reader if you are not completely clear.

In the last stage, \textsl{Implications for Model-based Studies of Future
Climate Change and Soil Erosion}, the future rainfall intensity scenario from
the second stage were used to estimate erosion rates using WEPP, one of the soil
erosion models used in this research. WEPP is used here because it is a
continuous simulation model, which is capable of simulating long-term erosion
taking into account the factors such as the complex overlap of temporally and
spatially diverse distributions of rainfall, erodibility, soil conditions, plant
cover \citep{nearing2006-145}.

The last stage of this thesis aims to
\begin{inparaenum}[1)]
  \item suggest the best possible way of investigating impacts of rainfall
\textit{intensity} changes on future erosion and
  \item try to test out the suggested method with intensity-change scenarios
constructed previously.
\end{inparaenum}

% The aims of all the stages are summarised below:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item To investigate the applicability of three models for subsequent
%investigations in terms of their process descriptions on rainfall intensity
%   \item To determine rainfall intensity information requirements for erosion
%simulations
%   \item To determine trends of rainfall intensity at the research site and to
%evaluate the consistency of the trend with GCM predictions \label{aim3}
%   \item To construct future scenarios of rainfall intensity changes based on
%the trend determined from \#\ref{aim3}
%   \item To suggest a method of investigating impacts of rainfall intensity
%changes on future erosion \label{aim4}
%   \item To set out an exemplary case study by using one of the suggested
%method from \#\ref{aim4} with the previously constructed scenarios of rainfall
%intensity change
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Some Questions To Be Answered}
\label{sec:ResearchQuestions}
By carrying out the above stages, this research intends to address the following
questions:
\begin{enumerate}[{Question} 1.]
  \item What role does rainfall intensity play in the process descriptions which
comprise erosion models?\label{researchquestion1}
  \item Assuming that we use a model to predict erosion rates under the future
climate which may have different rainfall intensities from the present, what
information do we need to make predictions in terms of both climate and process
understanding?\label{researchquestion2}
  \item What do we know about future rainfall intensity? Does any trend exist in
the present and past rainfall intensity at the study site? If so, is the trend
consistent with future rainfall intensity predicted by climate models? If not,
what must be done to estimate future rainfall intensity?
\label{researchquestion3}
  \item Are we in a position to predict soil erosion under the future climate?
If not, what must be done?\label{researchquestion4}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Outcomes}
\label{sec:ExpectedOutcomes}
Once all the research questions listed above have been answered, the following
outcomes can be attained:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Better understanding of the role of rainfall intensity in soil erosion
model processes,
  \item Information requirements of rainfall intensity for soil erosion
modelling,
  \item Probable estimation of future rainfall intensity, and
  \item Required criteria of rainfall data and erosion models for predicting
future soil erosion.
\end{itemize}
