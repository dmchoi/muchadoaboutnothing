\chapter{EFFECT OF IN-STORM RAINFALL INTENSITY CHANGES ON SOIL EROSION}
\label{sec:EFFECTSOFRAINFALLINTENSITYCHANGESONSOILEROSION}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:IntensiyPatternsIntroduction}
This chapter investigates the effect of rainfall intensity changes within
storm duration. WSIP (Within-Storm Intensity Pattern) means the temporal shape
of the storm's WSIV (Within-Storm Intensity Variation). It could be increasing,
decreasing or constant, or more complex. This is also related to the
time-to-peak parameter in WEPP.

\section{Simulation Data and Methods}
\label{sec:IntensiyPatternsMethods}

% In the previous investigation, it was assumed that rainfall intensity was
% constant during a storm period. In reality, rainfall intensity is constantly
% changing throughout the storm period. This will certainly have an effect on soil
% erosion.

A design storm was used. Rainfall intensity of the storm varied
to increasing, decreasing, increasing-decreasing and constant while keeping the
amount of rainfall unchanged.
%Intensity varied rainfall data (actually WEPP disaggregated data because of
%EUROSEM)
Only one peak intensity per storm was assumed for model simulations.

Two designed storms with average intensity of 10mm/hr (120 mm for 12 hrs)
and 60 mm/hr (120 mm for 2 hrs) were used for WEPP and EUROSEM simulations.
A designed storm with average rainfall intensity of 120 mm/hr was used for
RillGrow simulation.

The effects of these intensity changes on runoff and soil loss rate were
investigated using three models---WEPP, EUROSEM and RillGrow.
WEPP, EUROSEM and RillGrow are used to simulate runoff and soil loss, and
the effects of patterns were compared.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:ImpactsOfRainfallIntensityChangesOnRunoffAndErosionDiscussion}

In WEPP, WSIP is parameterized as $t_p$ which represents normalised
time-to-peak. This value was considered not much sensitive previously
\citep{nearing1990-839}.

%Discuss how the models respond to each rainfall patterns. Which one
%produced most runoff and soil loss?
%Which on produced least runoff and soil loss?

%What's the potential problem with constant intensity generating least
%runoff and soil loss (WEPP)?
%GCM and RCM data scale. knowing average daily rainfall intensity is not
%sufficient for erosion estimation. It may lead to underestimated erosion
%with low average intensity rainfall.

In this investigation, it is clear that WSIP is important for soil erosion
estimation. Without knowing future WSIPs, it could easily lead to erroneous
results. Moreover, when average rainfall intensity (i.e.\ constant rainfall
intensity) of low intensity events are used for erosion modelling, WEPP
immensely underestimates soil loss rates by about 50 times less than average
soil loss of other WISPs. This is a considerable
difference in comparison to runoff values which are similar for all four
cases (Table \ref{tab:WEPPSimulationResults}). This result with constant
intensity is consistent with \citet{parsons2006-68}.

\citet{parsons2006-68} conducted a lab test to investigate the effects of
intra-storm patterns (WSIPs) on soil erosion. They found that the
constant-intensity storm generated about 75\% of the average soil loss for the
variable-intensity storms.

RillGrow estimated the similar effects on soil loss as the result of
\citet{parsons2006-68}. RillGrow simulated, for constant intensity rainfall,
about 78\% soil loss from the average soil loss of other storms. It also
estimated more soil loss for the storm with decreasing intensity than other
storm patterns.

compared with the result from \citet{parsons2006-68} in Table

When WEPP,for example, is to be used for erosion estimations, it is
necessary to know $t_p$ and $i_p$ values of the rainfall storm for the
simulation.
As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:WEPPSimulationResults}, the presence of
$t_p$ have some effects on the result of simulations. It becomes more
evident when rainfall with low intensity is considered.

\citet{nearing1990-839} performed sensitivity analysis on WEPP, which was
still in the process of development, by assessing various input variables
such as soil, plant residue and canopy, hillslope topography, and hydrologic
input variables. They calculated sensitivity parameter, S, as a relative
normalised change in output to a normalised change in input.
They concluded that peak rainfall intensity, time to peak rainfall
intensity, rill spacing and width, and sediment transportability were not
playing a major role in soil loss predictions.

Because of the fact that their analysis was carried out on the developing
version of WEPP and this chapter used the new version of WEPP, their
findings may not be compared directly with the result presented in this
chapter. However, it is interesting to note that they used relatively high
rainfall intensity as a base value for the single storm model input
parameter. They used 100 mm/hr intensity while 10 and 60 mm/hr were used for
the analysis carried out in this chapter.
%This allows direct comparisons of sensitivities for input parameters which
%have different orders of magnitude.

%This echoes the findings by \citet{nearing1990-839}. need to cross check
%with Nearing1990. look for what intensity did he use for the storm. eg. is
%it close to 10 or 60 mm/hr?

However, when there is no peak intensity, in other words, when intensity is
constant, considerably less soil loss was generated in comparison to the
ones with a intensity peak.
This shows a problem in using RCM rainfall data directly for soil erosion
modelling because they usually comes as daily data.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ImpactsOfRainfallIntensityChangesOnRunoffAndErosionConclusion}
WSIP affects the soil erosion amount.
Runoff does not seem to be affected by WSIP
changes.
WSIP of events with high intensity have less
influence on erosion rate. Events with a constant low intensity produced
dramatically less erosion. This results is consistent with the lab
experiment and modelling.
