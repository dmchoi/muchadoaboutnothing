\chapter{THE PROBLEM IN CONTEXT}
\label{sec:PROBLEMINTHECONTEXT}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Rationale}
Soil is an important resource for the survival of the human race and is a
central component of environmental systems, together with water, air and
radiation from the sun. Undoubtedly, soil is one of the essentials for life on
Earth. Scientists have investigated various soil properties to ensure good
yields of crops, fibre and fuel \citep{cresser1993-192}. However, soils do not
necessarily always provide ideal conditions for plant growth. Many soil
processes can constrain plant growth: soil hydrology is fundamental for most of
these \citep{hudson1971-320, evans1980-mechanics, kirkby1980-1,
morgan1995-soil}. Among the most serious is soil erosion by water.

Globally, soil erosion by water is a serious present-day environmental problem
and its consequence is subject to extensive investigations
\citep{kirkby1980-1,morgan1995-soil}. Previously published simulation studies of
the effects of future climate change upon erosion indicate that, under land
usages that leave the soil unprotected, even minor increases in rainfall amounts
are likely to result in disproportionately large increases in erosion
\citep{kirkby1980-1, favis1995-365}.

Soil erosion rates may be expected to change in response to changes in climate
for a variety of reasons, the most direct of which is the change in the erosive
power of rainfall
\citep{favis1996-529,williams1996-381,favis1999-329,nearing2001-229,
pruski2002-climate}.
%Soil erosion responds both to the total amount of rainfall and to
%differences in rainfall intensity, however in some situations (e.g. when
%soil is already saturated) the dominant factor appears to be rainfall
%intensity and energy rather than rainfall amount alone.
Existing studies however almost invariably make the simplifying assumption that
distributions of future rainfall intensities remain unchanged from the present
\citep{favis1995-265,favis1995-365}. This is unlikely to be the case.
Intensities may change and/or the frequency of occurrence of high-intensity
events may change \citep{houghton1996-climate, watson1998-517}. Any increases in
the occurrence of high-intensity rainfall---even without any associated
increases in rainfall amounts---may well increase runoff, and hence erosion
rates \citep{kirkby1980-1, morgan1995-soil, parsons2000-723}. Thus, future
climate change will certainly affect rainfall intensities but our ability to
forecast future intensities is limited by the shortcomings of General
Circulation Models (GCMs) \citep{favis1995-365}.

Very few studies have attempted to quantify impacts of changes in future
rainfall intensity \citep{ipcc2001-1032}. Results from these few studies suggest
that more (or similar) rainfall than at present will occur on fewer
raindays---implying an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall amounts
\citep{watson1998-517}. If these predictions are correct, the implication for
future erosion rates are clear.

For these reasons, there is a urgent need for greater understanding of future
rainfall intensity changes in order to improve the ability of soil erosion
prediction.
