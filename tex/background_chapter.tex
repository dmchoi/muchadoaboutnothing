\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Rationale}
Soil is an important resource for the survival of the human race and is a
central component of environmental systems, together with water, air and
radiation from the sun. Undoubtedly, soil is one of the essentials for life on
Earth. Scientists have investigated various soil properties to ensure good
yields of crops, fibre and fuel \citep{cresser1993-192}. However, soils do not
necessarily always provide ideal conditions for plant growth. Many soil
processes can constrain plant growth: soil hydrology is fundamental for most of
these \citep{hudson1971-320, evans1980-mechanics, kirkby1980-1,
morgan1995-soil}. Among the most serious is soil erosion by water.

Globally, soil erosion by water is a serious present-day environmental problem
and its consequence is subject to extensive investigations
\citep{kirkby1980-1,morgan1995-soil}. Previously published simulation studies of
the effects of future climate change upon erosion indicate that, under land
usages that leave the soil unprotected, even minor increases in rainfall amounts
are likely to result in disproportionately large increases in erosion
\citep{kirkby1980-1, favis-mortlock1995-365}.

Soil erosion rates may be expected to change in response to changes in climate
for a variety of reasons \citep{pruski2002-climate}, the most direct of which is
the change in the erosive power of rainfall
\citep{favis-mortlock1996-529,williams1996-381,favis-mortlock1999-329,
nearing2001-229,pruski2002-climate}.
%Soil erosion responds both to the total amount of rainfall and to
%differences in rainfall intensity, however in some situations (e.g. when
%soil is already saturated) the dominant factor appears to be rainfall
%intensity and energy rather than rainfall amount alone.
Existing studies however almost invariably make the simplifying assumption that
distributions of future rainfall intensities remain unchanged from the present
\citep{favis-mortlock1995-265,favis-mortlock1995-365,favis-mortlock1999-329,
pruski2002-climate,pruski2002-7,o'neal2005-165}. This is unlikely to be the
case. Intensities may change and/or the frequency of occurrence of
high-intensity events may change \citep{karl1995-217,houghton1996-climate,
watson1998-517,karl1998-231,osborn1998-505,osborn2002-1313}. Any
increases in the occurrence of high-intensity rainfall---even without any
associated increases in rainfall amounts---may well increase runoff, and hence
erosion rates \citep{kirkby1980-1, morgan1995-soil, parsons2000-723}. Future
climate change will certainly affect rainfall intensities but our ability to
forecast future intensities is limited by the shortcomings of General
Circulation Models (GCMs) \citep{favis-mortlock1995-365}.

Few studies have attempted to quantify changes in future rainfall intensity
\citep{karl1995-217,houghton1996-climate,watson1998-517,karl1998-231,
osborn1998-505,osborn2002-1313}. Results from these studies suggest that, in
some regions at least, more (or similar) rainfall than at present will occur on
fewer raindays---implying an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall. If
these predictions are correct,
the implication for future erosion rates are clear. For these reasons, there is
a urgent need for greater understanding of future rainfall intensity changes in
order to improve the ability of soil erosion prediction.

This thesis, therefore, aims to address some of the issues involved in
predicting future soil erosion as a response to future changes of rainfall
intensity. More detailed aims and issues associated with achieving those aims
are presented at the end of Chapter 2. Prior to Chapter 2, topics that are
related to soil erosion processes, rainfall intensity, climate changes and
erosion prediction models are discussed in the following sections.
