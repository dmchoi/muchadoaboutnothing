\section{Soil Erosion Prediction Models}
\label{sec:SoilErosionPredictionModels}

\subsection{Background and Categories of Erosion Models}
\label{sec:Introductionerosionmodels}

To assess the risk of soil erosion, estimates of soil loss rates may be compared
with what is considered to be acceptable for conservation purposes; the effects
of different conservation strategies may then be determined. Consequently, a
technique is required to compare possible soil losses under a wide range of
conditions. One way of doing this is using computerised models for soil erosion,
which are (like all models) simplified representations of reality. Types of
erosion models are categorised by their structures in Table
\ref{tab:TypesOfModels}. It needs to be noted that the categories in Table
\ref{tab:TypesOfModels} tend to be mixed, nowadays.

%\citep{favis-mortlock2001-477}

Another categorisation scheme is based on objectives and levels of performance.
In this scheme, there are two basic types of models in addition to the
categories in Table \ref{tab:TypesOfModels}. One is a screening model, which is
relatively simple and designed to identify problem areas. This type of model
only requires predictions of the right order of magnitude. The other type is an
assessment model, which requires better, more robust, and accurate predictions
because it is mainly designed for evaluating the severity of erosion, for
example, under different soil management systems. Thus, depending on the purpose
to which a model is put, the appropriate level of complexity/simplicity of
the model should be established. A clear statement of the purpose of the study
is essential; this will serve as a starting point for all modelling procedures.

Our current understanding of erosion processes is greatest over short time
periods, seconds to minutes. It is thus problematic when applying this
understanding to longer periods, e.g.\ months to years or even longer, as is
necessary for real-world conservation tasks. It may just be feasible for
slightly longer periods such as hours or days, but continuous extrapolation is
not appropriate \citep{kirkby1992-180,morgan1995-soil}. Therefore, longer-term
prediction can only be achieved by summing the predictions for individual
events, or developing models empirically, using data collected on a long-term
basis, or improving our understanding of processes to be able to build
physically-based models.

relationships between assumed important variables where a reasonable database
exists. Three types of analysis are recognised:
    \begin{compactitem}[-]
      \item Black-box: where only main inputs and outputs
are studied;
      \item Grey-box: where some detail of how the system
works is known;

operates are known.
    \end{compactitem}\\

\end{sidewaystable}

In addition to these temporal extrapolation issues, the spatial extrapolation
issues must also be considered. For instance, the detailed requirements for
modelling erosion over a large drainage basin \citep{hooke2000-1778} may differ
from those demanded by models of soil loss from a short length of hillslope
\citep{goff1993-698}, or even at the point of impact of a single raindrop
\citep{sharma1991-301}. Until recently, integrating researches in different
scales (i.e.\ plot, field and catchment-scale) has been neglected because it is
a difficult task \citep{boardman1996-489}.

Therefore, prior to using a soil erosion model, where the model is to be
used and why the specific model is appropriate should be considered carefully.

For error and uncertainty involved in modelling approaches,
\citet{oberkampf2002-333} suggest two definitions of uncertainty: aleatory and
epistemic.
Aleatory uncertainty (also can be termed as `unknown unknowns') refers to
irreducible uncertainty, inherent uncertainty, variability and stochastic
uncertainty. A probability or frequency distribution is generally used to
quantify aleatory uncertainty, when sufficient information
is available.
Epistemic uncertainty (also can be termed as `known unknowns') refers to
reducible uncertainty, subjective uncertainty and cognitive uncertainty. This is
a source of non-deterministic behaviour that comes from lack of knowledge of the
system or environment. This uncertainty can also be viewed as a potential
inaccuracy in any phase or activity of the modelling process that is due to lack
of knowledge.

Thus, even if we eliminate epistemic uncertainty (or known unknowns) by studying
and obtain absolute knowledge, we will still not be able to predict future
weather perfectly because of the aleatory uncertainty (unknown unknowns).

\citet{oberkampf2002-333} defines error as a recognizable inaccuracy in any
phase or activity of modelling and simulation that is not due to lack of
knowledge. Using this approach, there are two types of errors: errors that are
acknowledged and errors that are unacknowledged. Acknowledged errors are
those inaccuracies that are recognised by the analysts. Unacknowledged errors
are those inaccuracies that are not recognized by the analysts, but they are
recognizable. The CLIGEN errors found by \citet{yu2000-301} can be seen as an
example of unacknowledged errors (See Section \ref{sec:ClimateGeneratorCLIGEN}).

\citet{oberkampf2002-333} further suggest a comprehensive and new view of the
general phases of modelling and simulation, consisting of six phases (Figure
\ref{fig:modelling_phases}):
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item conceptual modelling of the physical system
  \item mathematical modelling of the conceptual model
  \item discretization and algorithm selection for the mathematical model
  \item computer programming of the discrete model
  \item numerical solution of the computer program model
  \item representation of the numerical solution
\end{enumerate*}

phases for computational modelling and simulation.
\citep[From][]{oberkampf2002-333}}
  \label{fig:modelling_phases}
\end{figure}

This framework is a synthesis of the reviewed literature, with three substantial
additions compared to a more conventional viewpoint. First, it makes a more
precise distinction between the system and the environment. Second, it places
more emphasis on the distinction between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in
the analysis. Third, it includes a dominant element in the simulation of complex
physical processes; the numerical solution of non-linear Partial Differential
Equations (PDFs).

\paragraph{Conceptual modelling of the physical system}
Conceptual issues about the physical system are considered by determining all
possible factors that might affect the system.

\paragraph{Mathematical modelling of the conceptual model}
The primary activity of this phase is to develop detailed and precise
mathematical models. The complexity of the models depends on the physical
complexity of each phenomenon being considered, the number of physical phenomena
considered, and the level of coupling of difficult types of physics. Emphasis on
comprehensiveness in the mathematical model should not be interpreted as an
emphasis on complexity of the model. The predictive power of a model depends on
its ability to correctly identify the dominant controlling factors and their
influences, not upon its completeness or complexity. A model of limited, but
known, applicability is often more useful than a more complete model. Any
mathematical model, regardless of its physical level of detail, is by definition
a simplification of reality.

\paragraph{Discretization and algorithm selection for the mathematical
model}
Converting the mathematical models into a form that can be addressed through
computational analysis. Conversion of the continuum mathematics form of the
mathematical model into a discrete, or numerical, model. Specifying the
methodology that dictates which computer runs will be performed in a later phase
of the analysis to accommodate the non-deterministic aspects of the problem.

\paragraph{Computer programming of the discrete model---modular approach}
Algorithms and solution procedures defined in the previous phase are converted
into a computer code.

\paragraph{Numerical solution of the computer program model}
The individual numerical solutions are actually computed.

\paragraph{Representation of the numerical solution}
The representation and interpretation of both the individual and collective
computational solutions. Basically this phase concerns how to present results
for a group of specific audiences.

The erosion models used in the present research are reviewed in the next
section. However, an additional model, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE),
is first discussed since this model embodies the basic concepts underpinning
many more recent models such as the WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project)
model, which is also reviewed in this chapter.

\subsection{Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)}
\label{sec:UniversalSoilLossEquationUSLE}

The first attempt to develop a soil loss equation for hillslopes was that of
\citet{zingg1940-59}, who related erosion to slope steepness and slope length.
Further developments led to the addition of a climatic factor based on the
maximum 30-minute rainfall total with a 2-year return period
\citep{musgrave1947-133}, a crop factor to take account of the
protection-effectiveness of different crops, a conservation factor and a soil
erodibility factor, consecutively. All these factors were then incorporated
together, modified and up-dated to the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)
\citep{wischmeier1978-537}.

The USLE consists of six factors, which are simply multiplied together to
estimate soil loss although there is substantial interdependence between the
variables \citep{wischmeier1978-537}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:usle}
  A = R \times K \times LS \times C \times P
\end{equation}
where $A$ (tonnes$\cdot$ha$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) is average annual soil loss, $R$
(MJ$\cdot$mm$\cdot$hr$^{-1}$ ha$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) is rainfall erosivity, $K$
(t$\cdot$hr$\cdot$MJ$^{-1}$ mm$^{-1}$) is soil erodibility, $L$ (dimensionless
ratio) is the slope-length factor, $S$ (dimensionless ratio) is the
slope-steepness factor, $C$ (dimensionless ratio) is the cropping factor, and
$P$ (dimensionless ratio) is the conservation practice factor.

%
The rainfall erosivity factor ($R$) is related to the raindrop impact effect.
$R$ factor provides relative information on the amount and rate of runoff
associated with the rain. The soil erodibility factor ($K$) is used to represent
the differences of natural resistances of soils to erosion. The slope length
($L$) and steepness($S$) factors provide the topographic information that can
affect the rate of energy dissipation. The cropping factor ($C$) is the ratio of
soil loss from cropped field under specific conditions to the corresponding loss
from tilled, continuous fallow conditions. The conservation practice factor
($P$) is the ratio of soil loss with a specific conservation practice to the
corresponding loss with conventional slope tillage.
%

The USLE uses the empirical results of erosion studies conducted at many
locations over nearly a half-century of research, including rainfall erosivity,
soil erodibility, slope length, slope steepness, cropping and management
techniques, and supporting conservation practices of more than 10,000 plot-years
of data from about 50 locations in 24 states in the US
\citep{wischmeier1978-537}. The results were statistically analysed and the
relationships between the factors incorporated into equation \ref{eq:usle}.

Both the strength and weakness of the USLE lie in its estimation of erosion as
the product of a series of terms for rainfall, slope gradient, slope length,
soil, and cropping factors. However, it does not account for any non-linear
interactions between the factors \citep{wischmeier1978-537,meyer1984-99}.

\citet{nicks1998-377} suggests that USLE may be used to estimate soil loss on a
storm by storm basis where incremental rainfall is available. Rainfall erosivity
index ($EI$) for a rainfall event is calculated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:usleerosivityindex}
  EI=R_{0.5} \sum(210+89\,log_{10} I)
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the incremental rainfall intensity and $R_{0.5}$ is the maximum
storm 30 minutes rainfall.
Individual storm erosion amounts may then be calculated with the USLE using this
$EI$ value to replace the $R$ factor in equation \ref{eq:usle}, summed to give a
yearly soil loss, and then averaged to produce a mean annual erosion estimate.

In contrast, \citet{kinnell2005-851} points out important problems of predicting
event erosion using the USLE. One of the main problem described is that, in the
USLE, there is no direct consideration of runoff even though erosion depends on
sediment being discharged with flow, which varies with runoff and sediment
concentration. \citet{kinnell2005-851} concludes that the failure to consider
runoff as a primary factor in the USLE is the factor that causing the USLE to
produce the erroneous prediction of event erosion, which in turn leads to
systematic errors in predicting average annual soil loss.

Since the introduction of the USLE to estimate soil loss, it has become the
conservationists' primary tool for planning purposes
\citep{diaz1987-189,centeri2002-211}. The USLE provides an ease of use and
relatively reliable results, and requires only readily obtainable information in
order to estimate average annual soil loss. However,
\citet{wischmeier1976-misuse} warned about the problem of the misuse of the
USLE.

The database for the original USLE is restricted to the US east of the Rocky
Mountains \citep{wischmeier1978-537}. The base is further restricted to slope
where cultivation is permissible, normally 0 to 7\textdegree, and to soils with
a low content of montmorillonite; it is also deficient in information on the
erodibility of sandy soils \citep{wischmeier1978-537}. It is important to note
that, because the USLE was designed to estimate average annual soil loss from
any specific field over an extended period, soil loss estimates for a specific
year may substantially differ from the long-term average predicted by the
equation \citep{wischmeier1976-misuse}. Extrapolating the relationship beyond
the database for the original USLE, therefore, should be conducted with care.

The basic concepts of the USLE were subsequently used and developed by some
continuous simulation models. Some of these models are CREAMS (Chemicals,
Runoff, Erosion, and Agricultural Management Systems) \citep{knisel1980-creams},
EPIC (Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator) \citep{williams1984-129}, SWRRB
(Simulator for Water Resources in Rural Basins) \citep{williams1985-970}, WEPP
(Water Erosion Prediction Project) \citep{nearing1989-1587, flanagan1995-usda}.

\subsection{Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)}
\label{sec:WaterErosionPredictionProjectWEPP}

WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) is a process-based model that describes
the processes, such as infiltration and runoff, soil detachment, transport,
deposition, plant growth, senescence, and residue decomposition, that lead to
erosion \citep{flanagan1995-usda}. The model takes four input files, climate,
soil characteristic, slope, and crop management.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{./img/wepp_flowchart}
  \caption[Flow chart of WEPP]{Flow chart illustrating the components of the
hillslope profile of the WEPP model (from
\citealp{lane1989-usda}). OCP stands for Operational Computer Program}
  \label{fig:wepp_flowchart}
\end{figure}

WEPP was developed by the USDA-ARS (United States Department of
Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service) as a new-generation water erosion
prediction technology for the routine assessment of soil erosion for soil and
water conservation and environmental planning and assessment
\citep{flanagan2007-1603}. The development of WEPP was initialized with an
intention to replace the `long-used' USLE (See Section
\ref{sec:UniversalSoilLossEquationUSLE}) \citep{nearing1989-1587,
flanagan1995-usda}. WEPP no longer relies on factor values from the USLE,
instead uses separate erodibility parameters for interrill ($K_i$) and rill
erosion ($K_r$) \citep{flanagan1995-usda}. In WEPP, rills are assumed to have a
uniform rectangular cross-section with a uniform spacing of 1 metre. All rills
are assumed to be equally hydrologically efficient \citep{flanagan1995-usda}.

The steady state erosion component of WEPP is based on:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weppsedimentload}
  \frac{dG}{dx} = D_f+D_i
\end{equation}
where $G$ represents sediment load, $x$ is the distant downslope, $D_f$ is the
rill erosion rate, and $D_i$ is the interrill erosion rate. $D_f$ and $D_i$ are
calculated on a per rill area basis. Rill erosion, $D_f$, is positive for
detachment and negative for deposition, and calculated by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:wepprillerosionrate}
  D_f=D_c(1-\frac{G}{T_c})
\end{equation}
where $T_c$ is the transport capacity of flow in the rill, and $D_c$ is
detachment capacity of the rill flow and:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weppdetachmentcapacity}
  D_c=K_r(\tau_f-\tau_c)
\end{equation}
where $K_r$ is rill erodibility parameter, $\tau_f$ is flow shear stress acting
on soil particles, and $\tau_c$ is the critical shear stress or rill detachment
threshold parameter of the soil.
Interrill erosion is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weppinterrillerosionrate}
  D_i=K_i I_e \sigma_{ir} SDR_{RR} F_{\textrm{\scriptsize nozzle}}
\frac{R_s}{\omega}
\end{equation}
where $K_i$ is the interrill erodibility, $I_e$ is the effective rainfall
intensity, $\sigma_{ir}$ is the interrill runoff rate, $SDR_{RR}$ is the
sediment delivery ratio, $F_{\textrm{\scriptsize nozzle}}$ is an adjustment
factor to account for sprinkler irrigation nozzle impact energy variation, $R_s$
is the rill spacing, and $\omega$ is the width. Interrill erosion is also
expressed with baseline interrill erodibility as \citep{nicks1998-377}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:weppinterrillerosionratealternative}
  D_i=K_{ib} I_e^2 C_C C_G \frac{R_s}{\omega}
\end{equation}
where $K_{ib}$ is baseline interrill erodibility, $C_C$ is the effect of canopy
cover on interrill erosion, and $C_G$ is the effect of ground cover on interrill
erosion. The hydrologic variables that drive the WEPP are the effective rainfall
intensity and duration, the peak runoff rate, and the effective runoff duration.

The USLE erosion database could not be used directly for the WEPP
parametrisation. Three field experiments on cropland, rangeland and forestland
were conducted to determine parameters for $K_r$ and $K_{ib}$ given in equations
\ref{eq:weppinterrillerosionrate} and
\ref{eq:weppinterrillerosionratealternative}. A total of 77 sets of plot data
were collected \citep{nicks1998-377}. Fixed rainfall intensity was applied to
the plots using a rainfall simulator. A comprehensive model description is
available in \citet{flanagan1995-usda}.

Rainfall is represented in the WEPP with the double exponential function. A
storm is described with four parameters, storm amount, average intensity, ratio
of peak intensity to average intensity, and time to peak intensity. A stochastic
weather generator, CLIGEN (CLImate GENerator; \citealp{nicks1995-2}) is used to
generate these storm precipitation inputs. More about CLIGEN is covered later in
Section \ref{sec:ClimateGeneratorCLIGEN}. WEPP then disaggregates these storm
inputs into a single peak storm intensity pattern (time-rainfall intensity
format) for use by the infiltration and runoff components of the model.
\citep{flanagan1995-usda}.

The WEPP model can be used for hillslope erosion processes (sheet and rill
erosion), as well as simulation of the hydrologic and erosion processes on small
watersheds. The hillslope mode predicts soil erosion from a single hillslope
profile of any length. It can be applied to areas up to about 260 hectares in
size. The watershed mode links hillslope elements of specified widths together
with channel and impoundment elements. WEPP is designed to run on a continuous
simulation but can also be operated for a single storm. A modified version of
the hillslope WEPP has been developed for research purposes
\citep{favis-mortlock1999-329,favis-mortlock1996-529}. This is designed to
account for the effects of atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration changes on plant
growth.

In this research, only hillslope mode of the WEPP (v2004.7) was used for
continuous or single-event simulation, depending on the purpose. The current
version of the WEPP model is
2010.1\footnote{http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=10621, Accessed
in February 2012}.

\subsubsection{CLIGEN}
\label{sec:ClimateGeneratorCLIGEN}
CLIGEN is a stochastic weather generator, which generates daily time series
estimates of precipitation, temperature, dew point, wind, and solar radiation
for a single geographical point, based on average monthly measurements for the
period of climatic record \citep{nicks1995-2}. The estimates for each parameter
are generated independently of the others \citep{nicks1995-2}.

In comparison to other climate generators, CLIGEN is better at preserving the
low-order statistics of rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation on a daily,
monthly, and annual basis \citep{nicks1995-2}. Unique to CLIGEN is the capacity
to simulate the three additional weather variables to characterize the storm
pattern, namely storm duration, time to peak, and peak intensity, which are
specifically developed for the WEPP simulation \citep{flanagan1995-usda}.

CLIGEN stochastically generates four precipitation-related variables for each
wet day, which are precipitation amount  (mm), $R$, storm duration (hour), $D$,
time to peak as a fraction of the storm duration, $t_p$, and the ratio of peak
intensity over average intensity, $i_p$. Average intensity is defined as $R/D$.
Although it is possible to calculate individual variables manually for each
rainfall event, it is a labour intensive task to calculate the variables for
multiple events.

CLIGEN requires observed precipitation statistics in order to generate these
four precipitation-related variables (Table
\ref{tab:PrecipitaionParametersRequiredByCLIGEN}).

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption[Precipitation parameters required by CLIGEN]{Precipitation
parameters required by CLIGEN to generate WEPP precipitation inputs (from
\citealp{nicks1995-2})}
  \label{tab:PrecipitaionParametersRequiredByCLIGEN}
  \footnotesize
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    meanP & Average precipitation (inches) on wet days for each month\\
    sdP & Standard deviation of daily precipitation (inches) for each month\\
    skP & Coefficient of skewness of daily precipitation (inches) for each
month\\

    TimePk & Cumulative distribution of time to peak as a fraction of the storm
duration\\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Precipitation data required to derive the CLIGEN input parameters in Table
\ref{tab:PrecipitaionParametersRequiredByCLIGEN} are time series of daily
precipitation data and sub-daily precipitation data with a time intervals no
greater than 30 minutes \citep{nicks1995-2,yu2000-301}. In
principle, there is no need to distinguish these two types of precipitation data
because sub-daily data can be accumulated to produce daily values. In practice,
however, these two types of data usually come from two different sources. The
coverage of the daily data, both in space and time, is much more extensive in
comparison to sub-daily data at short time intervals. In addition, the two types
of data are normally stored in different formats. It is therefore useful to
treat the two types of precipitation data separately.

CLIGEN (version 4.2) was previously released with WEPP version 2001.3. However,
this version of CLIGEN had a major coding error and was modified substantially
\citep{yu2000-301}. CLIGEN (version 4.2) computed a ratio $\omega = R_{0.5}/R$,
where both $R_{0.5}$ and $R$ were rainfall depth (originally in inches).
$R_{0.5}$ had been converted from inches into millimetres (mm), while $R$ was
not \citep{yu2000-301}. The CLIGEN code was thus changed to correct this error.
This however led to extensively increased storm durations.

To accommodate the correction of unit conversion error, it was necessary to
incorporate two important modifications in the CLIGEN codes. First, a new
algorithm to determine the monthly means of the maximum 30-min rainfall depth
was implemented. Secondly, the parameter values for storm duration and the
coefficient of variation for the ratio of the maximum 30-min rainfall depth to
daily rainfall required in CLIGEN were estimated using the break-point rainfall
data \citep{yu2000-301}.

This error in the CLIGEN code has certainly affected the results from the
earlier studies, which employed the previous versions of WEPP and CLIGEN to
estimate soil loss
\citep{truman1993-405,zhang1995-1069,zhang1995-1079,zhang1996-855,
baffaut1996-447,laflen1997-96,baffaut1998-756,favis-mortlock1999-329}.

The version of CLIGEN at the time of writing is version
5.22564\footnote{http://horizon.nserl.purdue.edu/Cligen/, April 2006}. This is
the version used in this research. However, this version is not the current
version any longer. The current version of CLIGEN is
5.3\footnote{http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=18094, Accessed in
February 2012}.

\subsection{European Soil Erosion Model (EUROSEM)}
\label{sec:EuropeanSoilErosionModelEUROSEM}

EUROSEM is a dynamic distributed event-based model for simulating erosion,
transport and deposition of sediment over the land surface by interrill and rill
processes \citep{morgan1998-389}. The model has explicit simulation of interrill
and rill flow; plant cover effects on interception and rainfall energy; rock
fragment effects on infiltration, flow velocity and splash erosion; and changes
in the shape and size of rill channels as a result of erosion and deposition
\citep{morgan1998-389}. It can be applied to a small field and up to a small
catchment.

EUROSEM requires a one-minute resolution breakpoint rainfall data ideally for
the rainfall storm \citep{morgan1998-389}. The model then computes, using the
breakpoint rainfall data, the interception of the rain by the plant cover, the
generation of runoff as infiltration excess, soil detachment by raindrop impact,
soil detachment by runoff, transport capacity of the runoff and deposition of
sediment. The model has a modular structure that aims to make further
improvements of the model easier. The model considers the followings:
\begin{itemize*}
\item the interception of rainfall by the plant cover
\item the volume and kinetic energy of the rainfall reaching the ground surface
as direct throughfall and leaf drainage
\item the volume of stemflow
\item the volume of surface depression storage
\item the detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact and by runoff
\item sediment deposition
\item the transport capacity of the runoff
\item frozen soils and stoniness
\end{itemize*}

The flow chart for EUROSEM is shown in Figure \ref{fig:eurosem_flow_chart}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{./img/eurosem_flow_chart}
  \caption[Flow chart of EUROSEM]{Flow chart of EUROSEM (from
\citealp{morgan1998-389})}
  \label{fig:eurosem_flow_chart}
\end{figure}

Runoff generator and the water and sediment routing routines of EUROSEM are from
another model called KINEROS \citep{woolhiser1990-kineros}. The volume of
sediment passing a given point on the land surface at a given time is calculated
by a mass balance equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eurosemmassbalance}
  \frac{\partial(AC)}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial(QC)}{\partial x}-e(x,t)=
q_s(x,t)
\end{equation}
where $C$ is sediment concentration (m$^3$/m$^3$), $A$ is the cross sectional
area of the flow (m$^2$), $Q$ is the discharge (m$^3$/s), $q_s$ is external
input or extraction of sediment per unit length of flow (m$^3$ s$^{-1}$
m$^{-1}$), $e$ is net detachment rate or rate of erosion of the bed per unit
length of flow (m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$), $x$ is horizontal distance (m), and
$t$ is time (s).
The net detachment rate, $e$, is given as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eurosemnetdetachmentrate}
  e = DR + DF
\end{equation}
where $DR$ is the rate of soil particle detachment by raindrop impact (m$^3$
s$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$), and $DF$ is the balance between the rate of soil particle
detachment by the flow and the particle deposition rate (m$^3$ s$^{-1}$
m$^{-1}$).

The EUROSEM simulates erosion and deposition by calculating three main
processes, soil particle detachment by raindrop impact, soil particle detachment
by runoff, and transport capacity of the flow.

\paragraph{Soil particle detachment by raindrop impact}
\label{sec:SoilParticleDetachmentByRaindropImpact}
Soil detachment by raindrop impact ($DR$) for time step ($t_s$) is expressed as
a function of the kinetic energy of the rainfall at the ground surface, the
detachability of the soil and the surface water depth:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EUROSEMsoildetachmentbyraindropimpact}
  DR = \frac{k}{\rho_s} {KE} e^{-zh}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is an index of the detachability of the soil (m$^3$/J), $\rho_s$ is
the sediment particle density (=2.65 Mg/m$^3$), $KE$ is the total kinetic energy
of the net rainfall at the ground surface (J/m$^2$), $z$ is an exponent taken as
equal to 2.0 which varies between 0.9 and 3.1 \citep{torri1987-149}, and $h$ is
the mean depth of the surface water layer (m).
The kinetic energy of the rainfall is the combined energy from direct
throughfall and leaf drainage. The energy of the direct throughfall is computed
using raindrop size distribution found by \citet{marshall1948-165}. The energy
of the leaf drainage is based on a study by \citet{brandt1990-687}.

\paragraph{Soil particle detachment by runoff}
\label{sec:SoilParticleDetachmentByRunoff}
Soil particle detachment by runoff is based on a theory proposed by
\citet{smith1995-517}, and is given as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eurosemsoilparticledetachmentbyrunoff}
  DF = \beta w v_s (TC-C)
\end{equation}
where $DF$ is the rate of detachment of soil particles by the flow, $\beta$ is a
flow detachment efficiency coefficient ($\beta=1$ when deposition is taking
place and $\beta < 1$ for cohesive soils when $DF$ is positive), $w$ is the
width of the flow (m), $v_s$ is the setting velocity of the particles in the
flow (m/s), $TC$ is the sediment concentration in the flow at transport
capacity, and $C$ is the actual sediment concentration in the flow.

\paragraph{Transport capacity of flow}
\label{sec:TransportCapacityOfTheFlow}
EUROSEM uses two separate transport capacity relationships for rill and
interrill flows. Rill and interrill transport capacities are based on
\citet{govers1990-45} and \citet{everaert1991-513}, respectively. The equation
for rill transport capacity ($TC_{r}$) is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EUROSEMRillTransportCapacity}
  TC_{r} = c(\omega - \omega_c)^{\eta}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is unit stream power (cm/s) which is defined as $\omega = 10
\upsilon s$ ($\upsilon$ = mean flow velocity (m/s) and $s$ = slope (\%)),
$\omega_c$ is a critical value of unit stream power (0.4 cm/s), and $c$ and
$\eta$ are experimentally derived coefficients related to the median particle
size of the soil.
Interrill transport capacity ($TC_{ir}$) is modelled as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:EUROSEMInterrillTransportCapacity}
  TC_{ir} = \frac{b}{\rho_s q}\left[(\Omega -
\Omega_c)^{\frac{0.7}{n}}-1\right]^{\kappa}
\end{equation}
where $b$ is a function of particle size, $\rho_s$ is the sediment density
(Kg/m$^3$), $\Omega$ is Bagnold's modified stream power, $\Omega_c$ is a
critical value of Bagnold's modified stream power, $n$ is Manning's $n$, and
$\kappa$ = 5. Sediment delivery to the rills is simulated depending on the
transport capacity of the interrill flow.

Since EUROSEM uses a dynamic rather than steady-state approach used by WEPP, it
may be assumed to better represent the spatial and temporal variation of runoff
and erosion. However, the result of the model simulation may become considerably
uncertain due to its process-based nature that requires detailed model
parametrization \citep{quinton1998-65}. Particularly, EUROSEM requires high
resolution rainfall data (e.g. one-minute breakpoint data)
\citep{morgan1998-389}, soil hydrological information, detailed surface
geometry, and soil mechanical and vegetation characteristics. Because of the
detailed requirements of the model, application of the model is greatly
restricted to where such data are available.

\citet{parsons2000-181} found that because EUROSEM ignores small-scale
heterogeneities in the infiltration characteristics of soil, the model generates
delayed initiation times for runoff, so that predicted hydrographs showed the
commencement of runoff later than observed. Such variabilities in the
infiltration characteristics may be responsible for the
comparatively rapid initiation of runoff on the plot. They also found that the
subsequent soil detachment by runoff in interrill areas is overestimated by the
model even though, according to the model document, detachment by flow should be
negligible in interrill areas.

After personal communication (16 Jun 2004) with Anthony J. Parsons , it is
also noted
that EUROSEM may have a unit conversion error. The model document states that
the flow depth ($h$) in equation \ref{eq:eurosemsoilparticledetachmentbyrunoff}
is in metres. However, a study by \citet{torri1987-149} on which this equation
is based indicates that the height is in millimetres (see Figure 2 in
\citet{torri1987-149}). Anthony J. Parsons suggests that the height is in
centimetres rather than either metres or millimetres. If confirmed, this error
would have major effects on EUROSEM's ability to estimate runoff and erosion.
However, this was not investigated further in this thesis.

%First does the storm pattern affect the  runoff coefficient (same amount of
%rain but different amount of runoff) so  do differences in erosion result
%simply from more or less runoff?
%Secondly,  does the intensity pattern affect detachment so you get more or
%less erosion  because of the detachment effect.  We have something to say
%about that (sort of) in a paper in ESPL that should appear at some point
%(when I submit it!).
%So I think Mintae needs to look carefully at what is happening in the 2
%models in terms or runoff coefficients and detachment rates.

The version of EUROSEM used in this research is 3.9 (14/12/1998), which is the
current version of the model. It seems that the model development has been
ceased for some time.
%It may have been the case that the model developer have abandoned the model.

\subsection{RillGrow}
\label{sec:ModelDescriptionRillGrow}

While the later two erosion models (i.e. WEPP and EUROSEM) reviewed previously
are capable of realistically simulating rates of soil erosion, they (in common
with all other present-day erosion models) have a number of conceptual
shortcomings. For example, rills are considered to be equally spaced, with
regular cross-sections, and to be of similar hydrological efficiency. In
reality, rills are not necessarily spaced regularly and often have irregular
cross-sections. Adjacent rills may also vary greatly in their ability to
transport runoff and sediment \citep{favis-mortlock1996-248}. Additionally,
while such models separately describe the different processes responsible for
erosion in rill and interrill areas, they largely fail to acknowledge the
physical link that exists between the processes operating in the two zones
\citep{favis-mortlock2000-2173}.

The development of the RillGrow model
\citep{favis-mortlock1996-248,favis-mortlock1998-353,favis-mortlock2000-2173,
favis-mortlock2003-127,favis-mortlock2004-349} started with a consideration of
these shortcomings, and a question `\emph{Is the initiation and development of
hillslope rill systems driven by relatively simple rules acting on a much
smaller scale?}'. To test this hypothesis, a self-organising dynamic systems
approach was used to simulate the initiation and development of a rill network
on the bare soil of a small (e.g.\ plot-sized) hillslope area.

RillGrow is a single-event model, which generates realistic rill networks by
simulating, on a grid of microtopographic elevations, the combined erosive
action of overland flow moving between the cells of the grid. Surface water
arrives, a single raindrop at a time, on random cells of the grid. Runoff moves
over the grid following the steepest microtopographic gradient; as it moves, it
erodes the soil surface by lowering the elevation of the soil's surface. Each
change in elevation affects the routing of subsequent runoff: the result is a
feedback loop in which flow patterns over the grid at any time depend on earlier
flow patterns (and hence erosion), these flow patterns then condition subsequent
flow patterns, and so on (Figure \ref{fig:rillgrow_feedback_concept}).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]
{./img/rillgrow_feedback_concept}
  \caption[The conceptual feedback loop of RillGrow]{The conceptual
feedback loop of RillGrow \citep[From][]{favis-mortlock1998-353}}
  \label{fig:rillgrow_feedback_concept}
\end{figure}

The first version of the RillGrow model was able to realistically simulate rill
initiation and development, reproducing several features of observed rill
systems \citep{favis-mortlock1996-248,favis-mortlock1998-353}:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item a narrowing of rill spacing with increased slope angle
  \item an increased contribution of rill erosion with downslope distance
  \item a non-linear increase of total erosion with slope steepness
  \item an increase in rill depth below confluences and micro-rill piracy
\end{enumerate*}

However, RillGrow 1 has some important limitations. It ignores important process
descriptions (e.g.\ infiltration, deposition), and the hydraulics of rill
initiation are oversimplified. It also does not operate in a true time domain,
since at any moment during the simulation, only a single `packet' of overland
flow is moving over the topographic grid. Infiltration is ignored, thus all
water on the grid is assumed to be rainfall excess, and transport capacity is
assumed to be infinite because no deposition can occur
\citep{favis-mortlock2000-2173}.
All these limitations meant that it was not possible to validate the model in a
deterministic way, e.g. by comparing simulated and laboratory-produced rill
networks.

A second version of the model (`RillGrow 2') was developed to overcome some of
these limitations, and allow more rigorous validation
\citep{favis-mortlock2000-2173}. In RillGrow 2, overland flow in effect moves
concurrently between cells of the
microtopographic grid. Such concurrency is not easy to achieve on a
serial-processing computer, since only one instruction can be carried out at a
time. Concurrent processing is simulated in RillGrow 2 in the following way:
during a given timestep, outflow from each `eligible' wet cell is routed in a
random sequence which differs for each timestep. This variation in sequence is
necessary to prevent any artefacts of flow pattern which might result from a
fixed routing sequence. Over a sufficient number of timesteps, the model in
effect operates in `parallel', i.e. concurrently, in a true time domain.
RillGrow is now at version 6, parallelised for multiple computer processors
(personal communication with David Favis-Mortlock, 2012).

while
this set of rules does not change during the model simulation, the result of
applying the rules to a given cell depends on the past history of elevation
change both for that cell, and for adjacent ones.}

Go through all `wet' cells in a random sequence (which is different each
iteration). For each `wet' cell, check whether sufficient time has elapsed for
flow to have traversed the cell. If it has, then do the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Find the adjacent cell which has the steepest downhill (i.e.\
outflow) energy gradient. Note that this adjacent cell may or may not be already
`wet'.
  \item Attempt to level the energy gradient between these cells by
outflow of an appropriate volume, adding to (or creating) the store of surface
water on the adjacent cell.
  \item Erode this cell (i.e.\ lower its soil-surface elevation) by an
amount which depends on the outflow volume and velocity.
  \item If there are other adjacent cells with downhill energy gradients,
process these as above.
\end{itemize}\\

\end{table}

RillGrow 2 also uses a refined set of basic rules for the routing algorithm
(Table \ref{tab:TheMainRoutingAlgorithmUsedInRillGrow2}). A probabilistic
expression by \citet{nearing1991-81}, based on the random occurrence of
turbulent bursts, is used to represent flow detachment. Sediment load is
compared with transport capacity, which is calculated using stream power in an
s-curve expression developed by \citet{nearing1997-865}. Deposition is estimated
using the approach of  \citet{lei1998-3157}: this assumes deposition to be a
linear function of the difference between sediment load and transport capacity.

Infiltration is now simulated by RillGrow 2, however the approach used is still
very simple (Favis-Mortlock, personal communication 2006). Splash redistribution
is also represented, using the diffusion-based approach of
\citet{planchon2000-131}, modified to include attenuation due to surface water
depth (Favis-Mortlock, personal communication 2006). Additionally, a simple
linkage is made between overall volumes of sediment detached or deposited by
splash in any timestep, and volumes of sediment currently being transported by
overland flow (Favis-Mortlock, personal communication 2006). The distribution of
raindrop volumes is assumed to be normally distributed (Favis-Mortlock, personal
communication 2006).

In comparison to models such as WEPP and EUROSEM, RillGrow makes no explicit
separation between rill and interrill areas. Soil erosion amount is calculated
as the result of summation of soil losses from all areas.
%Explicit separation of rill and interrill areas turns out to be unnecessary,
%however.
Flow velocities are so low on interrill areas that little detachment occurs as a
result. On such areas, splash redistribution dominates.

\citet{favis-mortlock2000-2173} observes that RillGrow 2 replicates the
responses of RillGrow 1 including realistic rill spacing with respect to slope
gradient. In addition, the simulated spatial patterns of erosion compare well
with laboratory-based observations, as do total erosion, variation in rill
depth, and time-series of runoff and soil loss. Braided or dendritic flow
patterns can be made to emerge by varying rainfall intensity. At low rainfall
intensities, however, the definition and stability of rill patterns is less well
defined.

As originally constructed, RillGrow 2 assumed each storm to have a constant
rainfall intensity. For the research described in this thesis, RillGrow 2 has
been modified to use breakpoint rainfall data. This allows the model to simulate
rill initiation and development and total soil loss, as affected by rainfall
intensity changes (Favis-Mortlock, personal communication 2006).
